# 07a — CVR engine readiness (Phase 3, pre-implementation)

The CVR is the first commercial output to build. Per the delivery rule, every Forecast Final
Cost must be the explicit sum of its components and no number may be invented. This note
separates what workflow 07 **pins down** (safe to implement) from what it **leaves open**
(needs a decision before code), and lists the **input entities that don't yet exist**.

## Pinned — safe to implement as-is

- **Forecast Final Cost** = Cost Incurred + Cost Committed + QS Accruals + Prelim Forecast +
  Cost to Complete. A transparent sum of five stored components; drillable. (US-07-23)
- **Combined per package** = Order + Variation, for each of Cost, Value, Profit £. (US-07-33)
- **Profit £** = Value − Cost (per package, for Order / Variation / Combined).
- **Movement** = current value − prior CVR snapshot value, per line. (US-07-26)
- **CVR snapshot** retained per Claim Period. (US-07-27)
- **Cost Committed** = open work orders not yet invoiced; an approved Variation feeds Committed
  and only moves to Incurred when invoiced. (US-07-25)
- **Time control header** fields and **Weeks Ahead/Behind** = Anticipated Completion − Contract
  Completion (in weeks). (US-07-29)

## Open — needs your decision before implementation

1. **Profit % basis** — Profit % = Profit ÷ Value, or Profit ÷ Cost? (Affects every package row.)
2. **Weekly prelim run rate** for time-related overspend (US-07-30) — derived automatically from
   the Prelim Forecast week×item grid (mean weekly tendered prelim), or set per project? (Open
   question already flagged in workflow 07.)
3. **Cost to Complete** — "remaining contract scope × current rate-card position": is "remaining
   scope" = (1 − site-reported %) × tendered cost per package, or BoQ-quantity-remaining × current
   rate? The two diverge once rates move.
4. **Order Cost vs Order Value per package** — Value = tendered sell price for the package;
   Cost = ? (tendered cost / budget for the package, i.e. sell − tender margin). Confirm the
   source field for package Cost.
5. **Cost-code overrun policy** (US-07-20/21) — hard-block vs soft-warn-with-FD-sign-off, and the
   two threshold values (FD vs Director).
6. **Completion-% model** (US-07-43) — site-reported %, timesheet burn rate, or blended; if
   blended, the weighting.

## Input entities missing from the schema (block "Cost Incurred")

`Cost Incurred` = WO invoices applied + approved day-rate timesheets + **dayworks + contras +
retention movements**. Present in `JpmsContext`: `WorkOrders`, `Timesheets`. **Absent:**
`Daywork`, `ContraCharge`, `SubcontractorRetention`, and any "work-order invoice / payment
application" entity. These must be modelled (Phase-3 schema step) before Cost Incurred is real.

## Proposed build order once decisions are in

1. Add the missing input entities + their capture commands (daywork, contra, retention movement,
   WO invoice application).
2. CVR calculation engine as pure, unit-tested functions over those inputs (one worked example
   per output, hand-checkable).
3. `CaptureCvrSnapshot` command persisting a `CvrSnapshot` + its `ForecastComponent`/`MarginTrace`
   rows; `Movement` computed against the prior snapshot.
4. Wire `/projects/{id}/commercial` to the engine, replacing the (now-removed) seed snapshots.

## Reconciliation against the real "By France" workbooks (uploaded 2026-05)

Two real CVRs were supplied: the new Planyard-style pilot (`By France - Workbook.xlsx`) and the
old workbook (`April 26 - By France.xlsx`) with the Sub Contract Analysis / QS Accruals /
Prelim Forcast / Header sheets. These override earlier guesses where they differ:

- **Margin % is tracked on BOTH bases.** The Header Sheet reports "Profit as a percentage of
  cost" (17.85%) and "...of value" (15.15%); the per-package Sub Contract Analysis shows
  profit-on-**cost** (e.g. 8,228 ÷ order cost 55,660 = 14.78%). Engine now exposes
  `ProfitOnCostPercent` and `ProfitOnValuePercent`; `CvrPackageRow` exposes both; the package
  table shows on-cost (the company's per-package convention). **Corrects the earlier ÷value-only
  assumption.**
- **Tendered cost** is value at a 20% on-cost markup (Net Tender Cost 1,193,810 = Net Tender
  Value 1,432,573 ÷ 1.2). So a package's Order Cost can be derived from its sell value and the
  tendered margin when an explicit cost is absent.
- **Prelim Difference = Tendered − Forecast** (a saving is positive): on the Prelim Forcast sheet,
  Project Manager 20,000 − 2,500 = +17,500; Site Manager 45,000 − 94,650 = −49,650.
  **Corrected** — `PrelimForecastEntry.DifferenceAmount` now uses this sign and the prelim grid
  colours saving green / overspend red accordingly.
- **Header carries** EOT count (4), Weeks Ahead/Behind (−6, **negative = behind**), Anticipated vs
  Contract Completion, Valuation Certificate No, Retention @ 5%, retention release date. The
  Weeks Ahead/Behind figure is not a simple (anticipated − contract) ÷ 7 — derivation still to
  confirm with the QS.
- **QS Accruals** sheet uses Description / Add / Omit / Liability columns; Liability carries the
  running subcontractor + prelim cost. Matches `QsAccrual.NetAmount = Add − Omit + Liability`.
- **Input sheets exist in the pilot** (`Dayworks`, `Contra Charges`, `Sub Retention`) — their
  columns will drive the missing-entity definitions in build step 1.


Nothing in steps 1–4 is coded until the six decisions above are answered, because each one
changes a number the QS will check by hand.
