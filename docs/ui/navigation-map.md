# JPMS navigation map — every view reachable in the portal

Read from `jpms/Services/Navigation/SidebarFolders.cs`, `DesktopNavigation.cs`,
`WorkspaceSections.cs` and every `@page` directive under `jpms/Pages`, on 2026-09-03
(after the CRM orphan removal): **89 page components, 99 routes, 63 rail destinations.**

## Shape of the rail

`Home` → project picker → **10 collapsible folders** (58 rows) → **4 folderless rows** at the foot
→ signed-in identity + Sign out.

Folder order: Project · Subcontractor · Supplier · Internal · Time · Finance · Financial Reports ·
Xero · Audit · Admin. Foot: Control Centre · Document Triage · Xero Cost Allocation ·
Valuation Reports.

**Nav clamp (decision 2026-08-11).** Every row is gated to Managing Director and Finance Director;
administrators bypass every gate. Weekly Cashflow adds Accounts — the one deliberate exception.
The Admin folder's first four rows are administrators only. Every other role sees Home alone.
API authorisation is untouched by the clamp — those pages stay reachable by URL.

Rows marked **{project}** resolve their template against the picker; the rest are company-wide.

## Above the folders

| View | Route | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `/dashboard` | AdminHome for administrators, RoleHome otherwise; My Day workspace inline for Site Manager / Foreman / Site Operative. Tiles link to `/rfis`, `/projects`, triage backlog. |
| Project picker | — | Recently opened, full list, "Show completed" toggle, "View all projects" → `/projects`. Only rendered when the role's rail has a project-scoped row. |
| Sign out | `/logout` | Foot of the rail. |

## Removed 2026-09-03

The CRM front end — `/estimating-queue`, `/nurture`, `/sales-analytics` — three routed pages with
no rail row and no inbound link anywhere. Deleted with their plumbing (`LeadsTable`,
`LeadsBySourceTable`, `LeadStageBadge`, `ILeadStore`/`HttpLeadStore`, `jpms/Features/Leads`, the DI
and route registrations, three AI page guides). **Kept:** the Leads API (`api/Features/Leads`,
~20 endpoints) and the `list_leads` connector tool. The pipeline has no front door now — a decision
to revisit, not an accident.
