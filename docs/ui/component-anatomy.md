# Component anatomy — every JPMS view

Read out of the razor source on 2026-09-03 (526 files under `jpms/Pages`, `Components`,
`Layout`, `Features`; 89 routed views). Companion to `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`: that file says what
the tokens are, this one says what the views are built from and which shared components are
missing.

**Marks.** ✅ a real reusable component is rendered · ⚠️ hand-rolled markup that recurs across
views (extract it) · 🔒 one-off markup local to that view.

## Where it stands (2026-09-06)

The Stage 1 rounds (`docs/ui/stage-1-components.md`) built and rolled out the spine below: every
⚠️ for AuthGate, Header, AlertBanner, StatusPill, EmptyState, SearchInput, ChipTabs/SegmentedTabs
(as `TabRow`/`FilterChips`), RecordsTable (the shell + skin), FormField and InlineConfirm is now a
real component — `Page`, `PageHeader`, `Notice`, `Pill`, `EmptyState`, `SearchInput`, `TabRow`,
`FilterChips`, `RecordsTable`, `FormField`, `Checkbox`, `SectionHeader`, `StatTile`,
`ConfirmDialog`, `InlineConfirm`. The per-view trees below describe the views as they were
surveyed on 2026-09-03 and are kept as the map; read a ⚠️ in them as "was hand-rolled, now the
named component". Still open: `KeyValueList`, `LedgerStatementRow`, `StatusTransitionMenu`,
numbered `Pagination`, the generic column-model table, `PageLoadScope`, `NoticeService`.

## The five duplications worth fixing first

| Pattern | Where it stands |
|---|---|
| **Auth preamble** | 52 of 89 pages hand-roll `!isLoaded → LoadGate` / `!IsApproved → RequestAccessView`. `ApprovedSessionGate` already does it; 24 pages use it. |
| **Page header** | 68 of 89 pages build their own eyebrow / title / subtitle / action cluster. No `PageHeader` component exists. |
| **Status pill** | `Components/StatusPill.razor` exists and **no page uses it**; 24 pages hand-roll `rounded-full` spans. |
| **Alert banner** | Reported by every survey pass, often 2-3 per page. Classes drift each time. Nothing owns it. |
| **Records table** | 29 pages hand-roll a `<table>`. `SortableColumnHeader` exists and no page uses it. Seven domain tables were extracted; the generic one never was. |

`LoadGate` (70 pages) is the counter-example: one component plus a written rule got adoption.

## Proposed component spine

**1 · Shell** — `ApprovedSessionGate` (idle, 24/76) · `ProjectPageShell` (33) ·
`WorkspaceSectionNav` (9) · `RecordTabBar` (2)

**2 · Page chrome** — `PageHeader` (build, 68) · `ActionCluster` (build, ~40) ·
`Toolbar`/`ToolbarButton` (have, 10) · `SectionPanel` (idle — `Panel` exists, 13)

**3 · In-view navigation** — `ChipTabs` (build, ~30; decide links vs buttons) ·
`SegmentedTabs` (build, ~12) · `SearchInput` (build, ~15) · `FilterBar` (build, ~14)

**4 · Data display** — `RecordsTable` (build, 29) · `StatusPill` (idle, 0/24) ·
`StatTileGrid`/`Stat` (idle, 1/~8) · `LedgerStatementRow` (build, ~6) ·
`KeyValueList` (build, ~12) · `EmptyState` (idle, 2/~35)

**5 · Feedback** — `AlertBanner` (build, ~60) · `LoadGate` (have, 70) · `ErrorToast` (have)

**6 · Forms, dialogs, destructive acts** — `Modal` (have, 26) · `FormField` (idle, 10/26) ·
`InlineEditPanel` (build, ~8) · `InlineConfirm` — the two-click armed delete (build, ~6) ·
`StatusTransitionMenu` (build, ~4)

Two rules the codebase has not written down and needs: **when CRUD is a modal and when it is an
inline panel**, and **whether a chip row is links or buttons**.

## Project

### RFIs — `/projects/{id}/requests` · `/projects/{id}/requests/{kind}`
`Pages/ProjectRequests.razor` (280 lines) + `.razor.cs` — the project's RFI register; legacy General requests one tab behind. **Note:** unlike most pages this one hand-rolls its own `!isLoaded`/`RequestAccessView` preamble instead of `ApprovedSessionGate`.

### Cash Summary — retired stub
`Pages/CashSummary.razor` (10 lines) — no `@page` directive at all; the file is a dead comment-only stub ("Gone: … became the Cash Forecast … DELETE THIS FILE") left behind because a remote session couldn't `git rm` it. Not routable, renders nothing — no component tree to give.

### Finance Overview — `/finance` (route retired)
`Pages/FinanceOverview.razor` (10 lines) — **dead stub, not a page.** No `@page` directive, no markup or code — just a comment explaining the company-wide Financial Summary was replaced by Valuation Summary (`Pages/ValuationSummary.razor`, decision 2026-08-03) and an instruction to `git rm` the file. No tree to draw.

### Valuation Summary — `/finance/…` (route removed)
`Pages/ValuationSummary.razor` (10 lines) — dead stub, no `@page` directive and no markup. A code comment says the page was replaced by `Pages/CashSummary.razor` at `/finance` and asks for the file to be deleted (`git rm`); it renders nothing and has no route. Skipped — no component tree.
