# JPMS — Tender and award

A bid package is what people call "the tender" or "the enquiry": a STANDALONE record grouping
works across cost codes by trade — never a stage of the variation chain. Its tender list is the
firms being asked to price. Status on a tender-list row: `Invited` means ON THE LIST (the page
shows it as "On list"); it does not mean an email went out. `Declined` means they said no.
`Responded` means a quote is in. `Won` means awarded.

## The flow

1. **Build the package**: scope (update_bid_package_scope), line items, documents.
2. **Add to the tender list** (invite_subcontractors_to_bid_package). Say "added to the tender
   list", never "invited" — nothing emails until the invite is sent.
3. **The invite email** — see below. A person sends it; the connector prepares it.
4. **Quotes arrive by email.** NEVER hand-type a quote's figures: run extract_tender_from_message
   on the email, review what it extracted with the user, then save_extracted_quote. A typo in a
   tender figure survives into the award and the work order.
5. **Not every tagged email is a tender** — see "The Submissions tab's verdicts" below. A chase,
   an acknowledgement or a question is marked Discarded so it stops being offered for extraction.
6. **Award** (award_bid_package — confirm-first): awarding mints the work order to the chosen
   subcontractor.
7. **The PO email is a distinct second step** (prepare_work_order_email_draft): a draft in the
   shared mailbox for the human to review and send — the tool never sends.

## The invite email — read first, then decide the route

Before preparing any invite:
1. `get_bid_package_context` — the tender list with each row's status.
2. `read_record_emails` (record_type bid_package) — has an invite ALREADY gone out? The sent copy
   carries the package's tag, so it shows here. If it has, tell the user who it went to and when,
   and do not prepare it again unless they say so.

Then:
- **First invite, everyone on the list should get it** → `prepare_bid_package_invite_draft` with
  no `recipientIds`. Know exactly what it does: it BCCs every tender-list row still in the
  running — status Invited (on the list) or Responded — that has a directory email; Declined and
  Won rows are skipped. It attaches the pricing schedule, the company T&Cs, the package's tender
  documents and its linked drawings. Say this to the user before calling it, with the names.
- **Some of the list already had it, or someone has declined** → `prepare_bid_package_invite_draft`
  with `recipientIds` for exactly those who should get it — the `tenderList[].recipientId` values
  from get_bid_package_context, never company names. Work the set out from the sent copy's `bcc`
  in read_record_emails against the tender list, and say who is in and who is out (and why:
  already had it / declined) before calling.
- **Confirm-first.** The action refuses its first call. In that turn show the user who will be
  BCC'd (company and email) and what will attach, get their yes, then call again with
  `confirm: true` and the same arguments.
- **Reporting the draft**: the result's `attachedFiles` is the truth about attachments — report
  them from it by name. `linkedFiles` is ONLY the overflow (files too large to attach, which
  became download links) and is usually empty; never read an empty `linkedFiles` as "no
  attachments".
- The draft sits in the shared mailbox's Drafts, tagged to the package, for a person to send
  from Outlook. Replies file themselves under the tag.

## The Submissions tab's verdicts — Discard / Restore

The package's Submissions tab lists every email tagged to the package and the package's
verdict on each: a tender that has been extracted, or one still waiting, or not a tender at
all. Working a package means giving that verdict, not only reading the quotes.

- **A tagged email that is not a tender** — a chase ("have you had our quote?"), an
  acknowledgement, a question about the drawings, an out-of-office — is marked **Discarded**
  with `set_bid_package_email_disposition` (outcome `Discarded`, the email's `messageId` from
  `read_record_emails` on the package). It stays tagged to the package and the Emails tab is
  unchanged — nothing is untagged, nothing moves in the mailbox — it simply folds into the
  Submissions tab's "Discarded" accordion and stops being offered for extraction. **Restore**
  (outcome `Pending`) puts it back. Reversible either way, so neither needs confirmation: read
  the email, say what it is, mark it.
- **Extracted is never set by hand.** `save_extracted_quote` with `sourceMessageId` is what
  stamps an email Extracted, so the verdict and the quote can never disagree. If an email holds
  a tender, extract it — do not label it.
- Read the tab before extracting: an email already Extracted or Discarded is not offered again,
  and a package whose Submissions tab still shows Pending emails has work left in it.

## Directory hygiene

Tender-only prospects are NOT directory members. Promote a company into the directory only from
a submitted tender or at award (promote_subcontractor_to_directory) — the directory stays a
curated list of firms Jewel actually works with. Renaming a directory company to match its Xero
supplier name is what lines its invoices up on the allocation side.

## Quoting discipline

Never disclose one bidder's figures to another, and never put subcontractor pricing in anything
client-bound. Comparisons live in internal working documents only.
