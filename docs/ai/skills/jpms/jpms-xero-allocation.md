# JPMS — Xero allocation doctrine

## Why the portal's numbers beat Xero's reports

- **Draft bills are deliberate.** The coding procedure holds purchase bills in DRAFT until they
  are allocated through the portal, so Xero's own aged-payables report UNDERCOUNTS what is owed.
  Quote get_aged_payables / get_aged_receivables (drafts included), never Xero's report, for what
  we owe or are owed.
- **A cost only reaches a project when its line is ALLOCATED** to a project + master cost centre
  (or split across several). Unallocated lines are real money not yet in any project's spend —
  when project cost figures look light, check the Unallocated queue first
  (list_xero_ledger_lines).

## Allocation rules (the page's arming rules, as doctrine)

- A line goes to ONE of: project + cost centre, or a bucket (no project, no cost centre) —
  when both are somehow set, the bucket was the later deliberate act and wins.
- Half-allocated states exist on purpose: a line can carry its project (moving it to that
  project's tab and writing the Xero site) without being allocated to a centre yet.
- Disputed lines are a conversation, not an error state — the thread survives resolution.
- **Labour-registry suppliers' bills are timesheet SETTLEMENT, not costs** — they bypass the
  allocation queue entirely; labour cost enters projects through approved timesheets.

## Work-order invoice links

set_xero_line_work_order_links takes the line's COMPLETE slice list every time — read the
current links first (list_xero_ledger_lines with the projectId), modify, resend the whole set.
Sending a partial list silently drops the missing allocations.
