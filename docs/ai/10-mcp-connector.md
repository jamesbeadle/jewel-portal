# 10 — The MCP connector: the portal in everyone's own AI tool

*Written 2026-08-27, the day the turn-based side chat (06–09) was retired. This document describes
what replaced it and why, how the pieces fit, and how to extend it. It supersedes 04–09 as the
description of how AI reaches JPMS; those documents remain as the historical record of the chat.*

## 1. The decision

The in-portal chat ran every conversation through the company's Anthropic API key: the portal was
the AI product, and Jewel paid per token for it — model calls, transcript replay, reply collection,
the lot. The inversion: **the portal stops being an AI product and becomes an AI data source.**
Team members use whatever assistant they already pay for — Claude (web, desktop, mobile, Claude
Code) or Perplexity — and connect it to JPMS over the Model Context Protocol. Their subscription
covers the model; the portal serves data and records who did what. The three one-shot Procurement
helpers (tender extraction, bid-package suggestion, trade resolution) keep the API key — they are
embedded workflow steps, not chat.

What the chat's fortnight of hardening taught us carries straight over: the tool catalogue, the
role filtering, the evidence tools (sources, request context, record emails), the skill store and
the activity log all survive. What died was the conversation machinery — AiTurnRunner, transcript
budgeting, reply collection, UI actions, dialog tasks — because the conversation now lives in the
user's own AI tool, which is better at being a chat than a Blazor panel ever was.

## 2. The shape

Three pieces, all in the api project:

- **`Features/Connect`** — a minimal OAuth 2.1 authorisation server: dynamic client registration
  (RFC 7591), `GET /api/oauth/authorize` → the SPA consent page (`/connect/authorize`) →
  `POST /api/oauth/approve` (session-cookie authed; mints a single-use code bound to the signed-in
  user) → `POST /api/oauth/token` (code + PKCE S256, and refresh-token rotation). Public clients
  only — no client secrets; PKCE and the user's own portal sign-in are the security. Discovery
  documents are served under `/api/well-known/…` and surfaced at the standard `/.well-known/…`
  paths by rewrites in `staticwebapp.config.json`. Tokens follow the `SessionManager` contract:
  raw secret leaves once, SHA-256 hash at rest (`OAuthClients` / `OAuthAuthCodes` / `OAuthTokens`,
  migration `20260827190000_AddAiConnectorOAuth`). Access tokens live 7 days, refresh 90 with
  rotation; revoking a family (the AI Connections page, `/settings/ai-connections`) kills the lot.

- **`Features/Mcp`** — `POST /api/mcp`, a stateless Streamable-HTTP MCP server, hand-rolled
  JSON-RPC (`initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`; notifications → 202; GET/DELETE →
  405). Plain `application/json` responses, no SSE, no session ids — tool calls are short DB
  reads/writes and the SWA gateway allows ~45s. A missing/invalid bearer answers 401 with
  `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="…/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"`, which is
  what sends Claude and Perplexity into the OAuth flow. A valid token resolves to a
  `SignedInUser` via `SignedInUserResolver.ResolveByEmailAsync` (same directory + roles as the
  cookie path, revoked users refused), and `AuditActor` is set so every audit write inside a tool
  carries the token's user.

- **The tool catalogue** (`Features/Ai/Tools`) — unchanged in spirit. `AiToolCatalogue.ForConnector(user)`
  is the whole per-user filter: every tool whose `VisibleTo` admits one of the user's roles, and
  nothing else — the ADR-002 rule (a tool the caller could not use is never described) carried
  over verbatim. The chat-only tools (navigate_to, open_modal, update_open_modal, switch_agent,
  the Control-Centre staging tools, read_selected_email, chat attachments) are gone; the read
  surface (find_by_reference, get_request_context, the list_* family, sources, valuation/variation
  context, skills) remains, plus the connector's first **write tools** (`AiWriteTools`):
  `post_request_message`, `add_todo`, `complete_todo`, `log_todo_progress`, `save_skill`. Each
  write composes the SAME Authorisation + Validation + command handler its HTTP endpoint uses,
  actor stamped server-side — a write from Claude is indistinguishable in the record from a click.
  Financial actions, deletion and email sending are deliberately absent.

Images still work: a tool returning an `AiImageToolResult` marker is translated into an MCP
`image` content block, so the model sees drawings and photos, not base64 text.

### 2b. Why the MCP endpoint lives on its own host

Found live on launch day: Azure Static Web Apps **strips/overwrites the client's `Authorization`
header** before requests reach its managed functions (github.com/Azure/static-web-apps issues
158 & 275) — the OAuth flow worked end to end, then every bearer call answered 401. So `/api/mcp`
is served by a **standalone Function App** running the same api project
(`infra/azure-mcp-host-setup.sh` provisions it; `.github/workflows/jpms-mcp.yml` deploys it),
where the header passes through untouched. The split of responsibilities:

- **Portal domain (SWA)** — the SPA, every cookie-authed endpoint, the whole OAuth flow
  (register/authorize/approve/token) and the `/.well-known` discovery documents.
- **MCP host (Function App)** — the AI tools' JSON-RPC calls with the bearer. Its 401 points
  `resource_metadata` back at the portal's discovery documents, whose `resource` field names the
  MCP host's URL (`Mcp__PublicUrl`, set on both apps), so the client's audience check matches.

The Function App necessarily exposes the rest of the api's endpoints on its host too; they are
all session-cookie gated and simply answer 401 there — only `/api/mcp` accepts bearers.

Two Perplexity-shaped accommodations (2026-08-28, found when the first Perplexity connect
failed with "server does not support automatic registration"):

- **Discovery on the MCP host's own origin.** Claude bootstraps from the 401's
  `resource_metadata` pointer; Perplexity instead probes
  `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` directly on the MCP URL's origin. The MCP deploy
  workflow therefore blanks the Functions route prefix on that host only, and
  `WellKnownEndpoints` carries literal `.well-known/…` routes (inert under the portal's `api`
  prefix) plus an `api/mcp` alias in `McpEndpoint` so the published URL is unchanged. The
  root-served AS metadata names the MCP host as `issuer` (RFC 8414 origin check) with the
  endpoints still on the portal.
- **A client secret at registration.** Perplexity hard-errors when DCR returns no
  `client_secret`, even registering as a public client. Registration now issues one (hash at
  rest, `OAuthClients.SecretHash`, migration `20260828100000_AddOAuthClientSecret`); the token
  endpoint verifies it only when presented (form or Basic). PKCE remains mandatory and
  Claude's secretless clients are untouched.

### 2c. The action gateway — full write parity (2026-08-28)

The §2 "first write tools" were day one. The connector now mirrors **every command endpoint the
pattern can honour (~236 actions)** — record creation and editing, status changes, approvals,
financial actions, portal email sends — through THREE gateway tools rather than 236 first-class
ones (200+ schemas would drown every MCP client's context):

- **`list_actions`** — the catalogue, filtered to the caller's roles at listing (ADR-002 applies
  to actions exactly as to tools), grouped by area, one line each.
- **`describe_action`** — one action's full description, notes and its JSON argument schema,
  generated by reflection from the command contract (`AiActionSchema`).
- **`perform_action`** — executes it: bind arguments onto the contract with the actor stamped
  server-side (`EmailStamps`/`NameStamps` mirror exactly what the HTTP endpoint stamps — those
  parameters never appear in the schema), then the SAME Authorisation.Allows (typed-overload
  matched), Validation.Check/CheckAsync and ICommandHandler the endpoint composes, resolved from
  the same DI scope. Handler guard exceptions (InvalidOperationException) return as messages,
  mirroring the endpoints.

Declarations live in `Features/Ai/Tools/Actions/*Actions.cs` — one data-only `AiAction` entry per
command, one file per area, discovered via `IAiActionSource` at boot. `AiActionRegistry` asserts
the lot at startup (through `AiRegistryDriftCheck`): duplicate names, stamps that aren't contract
parameters, or a gate class lacking a typed Allows/Check overload for the command all kill the
boot. Endpoints that could not be mirrored — multipart uploads, endpoints with inline role checks
and no Authorisation class, flags the server derives from roles (UpdateManualWorkOrder) — are
recorded as `// Skipped:` comments at the bottom of each area file: the written record of what
the gateway does NOT cover and why. A skipped endpoint that later grows a proper Authorisation
class can then be declared.

## 3. Audit

Every `tools/call` writes one `AgentActivity` row (`AgentTrigger.Mcp`, actor = the token's user,
the tool name, a clipped argument summary, duration, outcome) — the Agent Activity page reads
exactly as before. Write tools additionally append to the client-facing `AuditTrail`
(`NotePosted` / `TodoCreated` / `TodoCompleted`). The AI Connections page lists live connections
(per user; administrators can list everyone's) and revokes them.

## 4. Extending it

- **A new read tool** declares the RoleSet its backing query gates on — same rule as ever, checked
  by conscience and review; `AiRegistryDriftCheck` (slimmed, still boot-failing) enforces name
  uniqueness and record-type reachability. Add the record type's reach entry in the same commit.
- **A new write tool** goes in `AiWriteTools`, composing the existing Authorisation + Validation +
  handler for its command, with `AuditTrail` after success. Say plainly in the description that it
  writes, and what.
- **Scopes** are deliberately one (`portal`); per-tool permissioning is the user's roles, applied
  at execution, not OAuth scopes.
- The connector has no conversation state to budget, no prompts to keep in step — the drift
  surface is the catalogue itself.

## 5. Operations

- No new secrets. The Anthropic key stays only for the Procurement helpers.
- New tables are additive (`AddAiConnectorOAuth` — apply before/with deploy); the chat tables drop
  in `20260827200000_DropAiChatTables` (apply after the deploy). Scoped scripts only, per
  CLAUDE.md.
- The `ai-attachments` blob container is orphaned once the chat tables drop —
  `infra/run-ai-attachments-lifecycle.sh` (or container deletion) reclaims it.
- Kill switch: revoke connections per user on the AI Connections page; for everything at once,
  stop the MCP Function App (`az functionapp stop`) — the portal itself is untouched.
- Team setup instructions: `docs/Portal-AI-Connector-Team-Guide.md`.
