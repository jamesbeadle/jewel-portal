# Automation Task Coverage Audit

Maps every "Automated Tasks" row in `Jewel Task Analysis (1).xlsx` to the workflow and (where created) user journey that captures it inside JPMS. Confirms the actor's persona exists.

**Sourced from:** [`/docs/meetings/2026-05-20-coverage-audit-and-additions.md`](../meetings/2026-05-20-coverage-audit-and-additions.md)

**Source spreadsheet:** `Jewel Task Analysis (1).xlsx` — *Automated Tasks* tab (rows 4–50). Column A holds Nigel's automation notes; column E names the staff member; column F names the task.

**Status:** Draft — rows confirmed as the named owners walk each workflow.

## Coverage status legend

- ✅ **Covered** — explicit workflow exists and captures the task.
- 🟡 **Partial** — workflow exists but the task surfaces a sub-step or rule that should be made explicit.
- 🆕 **New scope** — not in the original 21 workflows; added as part of this audit (workflow 22 / 23 / etc.).
- ⚪ **Out of operational scope** — meta / governance / one-off task that doesn't belong in an operational workflow.

## Persona coverage check

Every named task actor maps to an existing persona. No new personas surfaced.

| Staff member | Mapped persona | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| James Clark | P03 Project & Commercial Lead | Tasks span tender → bid → valuation → site reporting → AP triage. Confirms P03's broad scope. |
| Chris Reeves | P03 Project & Commercial Lead | Estimating / commercial slice of the same role. Confirms P03 absorbs internal QS work. |
| Jeremy Ferendinos | P07 Finance Director | All finance tasks fall to P07 as expected. |
| Sofia | P04 Office & Compliance Coordinator | Folder upkeep is residual after workflow 21 rollout. |
| Sarah Collins | P04 Office & Compliance Coordinator | Compliance + H&S + front-of-house bulletins all under P04. Surfaces TBT / PPE sub-needs (see partial coverage above). |
| Katie-Louise Hicks | P04 Office & Compliance Coordinator | Attendance + WOs + compliance dates + client updates all under P04. |

## Items added to backlog from this audit

The partial-coverage (🟡) rows above produce these follow-ups inside existing workflow files (no new workflows required for them):

1. **Workflow 18 / 08 — Toolbox Talks (TBT) reminders.** Add a weekly TBT distribution rule with topic catalogue and acknowledgement capture. Triggered by row 41.
2. **Workflow 08 — Broad subcontractor notifications.** Add a generic "notify all active subcontractors on this project" channel (uniform / PPE / TBT / one-off messages). Triggered by rows 41–42.
3. **Workflow 20 — Scheduled content distribution.** Add scheduling of "shareable bulletins" (industry H&S notices, etc.) to target groups. Triggered by row 38.
4. **Workflow 17 — Policy review cadence.** Add an annual review reminder for each governance policy (IT, AI, cybersecurity, GDPR). Triggered by row 45.
5. **Cross-cutting — AI exception / review queue UX.** Confirm in each workflow's exception queue (especially 09, 13, 03 award) that the review surface is consistent. Triggered by row 22.

## New workflows surfaced by this conversation (not in the spreadsheet)

Outside the 47 spreadsheet rows, Nigel's notes on 2026-05-20 added scope that warranted **new** workflow files:

| # | New workflow | Why | Sourced from |
|---|---|---|---|
| 22 | [Timesheet Management (cost-code-aware)](../workflows/22-timesheet-management.md) | Client-facing timesheet approval with cost-code allocation. Hard rule: cannot allocate to a cost code with no budget unless a work order is raised or allocation moves to a different cost code. | [Note 2026-05-20 additions](../meetings/2026-05-20-coverage-audit-and-additions.md) |
| 23 | [Project Completion Settlement & VAT Analysis](../workflows/23-project-completion-settlement.md) | On project completion, settle all timesheet / cost-code allocations; perform zero-rated VAT analysis and agree with client. | [Note 2026-05-20 additions](../meetings/2026-05-20-coverage-audit-and-additions.md) |

## Workflow extensions surfaced by Nigel's project-management outline

Nigel's hierarchical outline (New Project → Architect drawings → bid packages → approval/rejection; Project Change → Architect updated drawings / Client change / Site issues; Project Change Actions → VO → bid packages → approval/rejection → VO approved; RFI; NoD; Reports — Programme Valuation Report with Claim Values per Claim Period; VO List) maps mostly onto existing workflows. The following points were under-specified in the original audit and have been made explicit:

| Outline item | Current coverage | Action taken |
|---|---|---|
| New Project → Architect issues drawings | Workflow 01 (drawing receipt) | ✅ already covered. |
| Send work tender (bid packages) | Workflow 03 | ✅ already covered. |
| Subcontractor approval / rejection | Workflow 03 | ✅ already covered (comparison + award routing). |
| Project Change — Architect updated drawings / Client change / Site issues | Workflow 04 trigger | ✅ already in workflow 04 trigger. |
| Project Change Actions — **VO triggers a bid package loop** | Workflow 04 implied; not explicit | 🆕 Made explicit in workflow 04 (variation with subcontractor procurement). |
| VO approved → updates programme + valuation | Workflow 04 → 05 | ✅ already covered. |
| Reports — **Programme Valuation Report with Claim Values per Claim Period** | Workflow 05 (valuation generator) | 🆕 Made explicit: workflow 05 now names "Programme Valuation Report" and "Claim Period" as first-class concepts. |
| Reports — **Variation Orders list report** | Workflow 04 (register) | 🆕 Made explicit: workflow 04 now lists the VO List report as a deliverable of the register. |
