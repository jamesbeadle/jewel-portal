# Permission Matrix (Role × Workflow)

Coarse-grained matrix of which role is responsible for what across the twenty-one workflows. This is the at-a-glance reference. Per-step CRUD permissions live in each workflow file (and, once written, in each user-journey file).

**Sourced from:** [`/docs/meetings/2026-05-20-jbb-workflow-audit.md`](../meetings/2026-05-20-jbb-workflow-audit.md)

**Status:** Draft — refined per workflow as the deep-dive sessions happen.

---

## Legend

- **O** — Owner. Accountable for the workflow end-to-end.
- **A** — Approver. Sign-off authority at a defined step.
- **C** — Contributor. Materially supplies data or carries out steps.
- **R** — Read access only.
- **—** — No access / not involved.

When two letters apply, list both (e.g. `O / A` for "owns and signs off"; `C (M)` for "contributor via mobile only").

## Read across

- **P07 Finance Director** is the busiest role on the matrix — owner on five workflows and approver on most of the rest. Aligns with the audit's finding that finance workloads (AP, inbox, cashflow) dominate current monthly hours.
- **P03 Project & Commercial Lead** owns the project lifecycle group (02–05, 07) and is approver on the rest of it. The role absorbs internal QS work.
- **P04 Office & Compliance Coordinator** owns the operational glue — compliance, comms, materials, fleet, document upkeep.
- **External roles** (P01 Architect, P02 Subcontractor) are mostly source / recipient on JPMS, never owner. This shapes the external-portal scope: read what's published to them, write only their own contributions.
- **P09 Outsourced IT Helpdesk** is the only role whose JPMS surface is deliberately narrow — provisioning hooks and audit reports only.

## Process for refining this matrix

1. When a workflow file moves from **Draft** → **In Review**, walk the row above with the named operational owner.
2. Capture per-step CRUD permissions inside the workflow file (and inside derived user-journey files).
3. Update the relevant cell in this matrix.
4. When all rows are confirmed, root [`README.md`](../../README.md) §4.7 "Permission matrix populated" can be ticked.
