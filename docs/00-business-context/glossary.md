# Glossary

Construction and Jewel-Enterprises-specific terms used across this scoping repository. Add to this file whenever a discovery session surfaces a new term. Definitions should come from the people who use the term — capture in a meeting note first, then add here.

---

**Cashflow Forecast**
A projection of incoming and outgoing cash across the business, produced by the Accountant for the Managing Director. Depends on real-time-ish completion data per project and the timing of valuation invoices.

**Cost Code**
A reference defined by a client architect, used to categorise work for the architect's own billing and reporting. Cost codes must be referenceable from line items, completion records, and valuation-invoice documentation tied to that architect's tender.

**Drawing**
A construction drawing attached to a tender (CAD export, PDF, etc.) defining what needs to be built.

**Line Item / Tender Line Item**
A discrete unit of priced work within a tender (e.g. "install kitchen worktop"). Used for both pricing and completion tracking. Updated by VOs when scope changes.

**MD (Managing Director)**
The business owner — executive decisions across all projects.

**Programme / Project Programme / Programme of Work**
The plan of work to be delivered against a tender, tracked against its baseline. The platform's central organising concept. Always the UK spelling "Programme" — never "Schedule" or "Program" — in UI copy, code identifiers, and docs. Working name for the initial software: **JPMS**.

**Project**
A unit of work delivered for an architect, originating from an accepted tender.

**QS (Quantity Surveyor)**
The role responsible for pricing tenders into line items and capturing site measurements.

**RFI (Request for Information)**
A formal question raised by a Subcontractor (or other party on site) seeking clarification on scope, specification, or drawing when work cannot proceed without an answer. RFI resolutions often produce VOs.

**Subcontractor**
A field worker delivering work against tender line items. External to Jewel Enterprises.

**Tender**
A package of drawings and specifications sent by an Architect to Jewel Enterprises, defining the work to be delivered. Tenders are priced by the QS into line items.

**Timesheet**
A record of time spent on a project by a Subcontractor, used for cost tracking and payment.

**Valuation Invoice** *(formerly "Cash Call")*
The canonical term for an amount of money Jewel has claimed for the client to pay, raised against the current valuation based on the percentage of work completed. Lifecycle: Raised → Issued (counts toward certified/invoiced to date) → Paid. Valuation-invoice accuracy depends on accurate line-item completion data — this is the central data-flow concern of the initial platform. Use "valuation invoice" everywhere; "cash call" survives only in historical meeting notes and old migration files.

**VO (Variation Order)**
A formal update to a tender's line items, typically arising from an RFI or scope change. Once approved, line items are added, changed, or removed. Completed VO work is billable to the client via a valuation invoice.
