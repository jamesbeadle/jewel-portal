# Workflows

Process maps that complement user journeys. Where a journey describes **what one actor experiences**, a workflow describes **what happens across actors and systems** for a given process.

> 📁 **`_templates/`** holds reference-only example diagrams. Real workflows live in this folder root.

## Where the workflows come from

The current twenty-one workflows were captured from the **JBB workflow audit (May 2026)** — `JBB_Workflow_Maps.docx`, ingested into the repo on 2026-05-20. Every workflow file in this folder is sourced from [`/docs/meetings/2026-05-20-jbb-workflow-audit.md`](../meetings/2026-05-20-jbb-workflow-audit.md). The audit produced acceptance criteria for each workflow; once the named operational owner confirms the file, those criteria become the JPMS test cases for that workflow.

---

## Conventions

- One file per workflow: `NN-short-kebab.md` (e.g. `09-accounts-payable.md`).
- Mirror the audit structure: purpose, trigger, frequency, owner, current monthly hours, current state, target flow, JPMS functionality required, integrations, acceptance criteria, entities touched, roles involved, open questions, confirmation checklist.
- Mermaid is the default notation for any embedded diagrams (renders natively on GitHub).
- BPMN (via Camunda Modeler or bpmn.io) for finance / approval flows where formal notation is needed for audit. Use `.bpmn` source files alongside the `.md`.

## Process for adding a real workflow

1. A workflow is usually identified during an audit or while reviewing a journey. Capture which meeting it came from.
2. Look at [`_templates/workflow-example.mmd`](_templates/workflow-example.mmd) for the shape of a Mermaid flowchart — reference only.
3. Create the new file in this folder using the next number prefix.
4. Add the row to the index below and to root [`README.md`](../../README.md#6-user-journeys--workflows) §6.
5. Walk it with the named owner; tick the confirmation checklist when signed off.

## Phased delivery (from the audit's recommended order)

1. **Phase 1 — Finance ROI:** 09, 10, 11, 13. Highest current-hour cost; primary pain-point anchor (workflow 11) sits here.
2. **Phase 2 — JPMS project-lifecycle core:** 03, 04, 01, 05, 06.
3. **Phase 3 — Everything else:** 02, 07, 08, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

This phasing is mirrored in root [`README.md`](../../README.md#116-roadmap-rough) §11.6.
