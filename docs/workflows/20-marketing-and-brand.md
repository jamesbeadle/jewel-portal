## Current state

1. Social posts created in Canva from project photos.
2. Brochure updated in Canva / Word as projects complete.
3. Brand asset folders maintained in SharePoint / OneDrive.

---

## Target flow (post-automation)

1. Content calendar held in a marketing module (lightweight, can sit outside JPMS).
2. Project completion in JPMS auto-flags eligibility for content (with consent flag).
3. Brand asset library version-controlled.
4. Director review and sign-off captured in-system before publish.

## JPMS functionality required

> Adjacent — mostly outside JPMS scope.

- Project "content-eligible" flag with client consent capture.
- Asset library link.

---

## Integrations & adjacent systems

- **Canva**.
- **Meta Business**, **LinkedIn**.
- **Scheduling tool** (TBD).

---

## Acceptance criteria — "done looks like"

- Director approval is recorded before posts go live.
- Content draws from current project data, not screenshot hunts.
- Brand assets aren't duplicated across folders.

## Open questions

- [ ] Consent capture — at handover, or per-asset?
- [ ] Where lives the brand kit — JewelBB brand-voice skill, Canva, both?
- [ ] Does the marketing tool need read-only access to JPMS project status?
