# Workflow 17 — IT & Systems Administration

**Group:** People, systems & support
**Purpose:** Day-to-day IT support, M365 administration, SharePoint/Teams permissions, and security/licensing oversight.
**Trigger:** Staff issue raised; system change; security/renewal cycle.
**Frequency:** Daily (support); periodic (admin).
**Owner (target):** Outsourced IT helpdesk (recommended); FD for governance only.
**Current monthly hours:** ~50 h/month.
**Status:** Draft
**Last reviewed:** —
**Sourced from:** [`/docs/meetings/2026-05-20-jbb-workflow-audit.md`](../meetings/2026-05-20-jbb-workflow-audit.md)

## Current state

1. FD handles all day-to-day IT support across the group.
2. FD also manages M365 admin, SharePoint/Teams permissions, Entra, Intune, Defender.
3. Security reviews and licensing checks done by FD periodically.
4. Systems map and architecture documentation maintained in Excel.

---

## Target flow (post-automation)

1. Outsourced IT helpdesk (3rd party) handles all tier-1 support.
2. M365 admin tasks routed via helpdesk for routine items; FD retains governance.
3. Onboarding/offboarding triggered via workflow 16, not FD ad hoc.
4. Security and licensing on a calendar with auto-reminders.
5. Architecture docs live in a wiki, updated as changes are made (not Excel).

## JPMS functionality required

> Limited JPMS scope — mostly outside the system.

- Provisioning hooks from workflow 16.
- Reminder calendar for renewals and reviews.
- Access audit reports.

---

## Integrations & adjacent systems

- **M365 Admin**, **Entra**, **Intune**, **Defender**.
- **1Password**.
- **3rd-party helpdesk** (TBD provider).

---

## Acceptance criteria — "done looks like"

- FD is not the helpdesk.
- Routine IT tasks are not in the FD's inbox.
- Security and licensing reviews happen on schedule, not when remembered.
