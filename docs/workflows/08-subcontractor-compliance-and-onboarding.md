# Workflow 08 — Subcontractor Compliance & Onboarding

**Group:** Supplier & subcontractor management
**Purpose:** Maintain up-to-date insurance, certifications, tickets, CIS status, and RAMS for every subcontractor working on a project.
**Trigger:** New subcontractor added; expiry approaching; project requiring RAMS; CIS check needed.
**Frequency:** Continuous; ~6 tasks/month per active subcontractor tracking cycle.
**Owner (target):** Office & Compliance Coordinator (oversight); JPMS for tracking and reminders.
**Current monthly hours:** ~10 h/month.
**Status:** Draft
**Last reviewed:** —
**Sourced from:** [`/docs/meetings/2026-05-20-jbb-workflow-audit.md`](../meetings/2026-05-20-jbb-workflow-audit.md)

## Current state

1. Subcontractor details kept in Monday.com, SharePoint folders, and an Excel tracker.
2. Insurance / certificate expiry chased manually 30 days before expiry.
3. RAMS drafted in RAMsApp per project, sent to client for approval.
4. CIS verified manually through the HMRC portal.

---

## Target flow (post-automation)

1. Single subcontractor record in JPMS with all compliance docs attached.
2. Expiry dates tracked centrally; automated reminders 60/30/7 days before.
3. Subcontractor has a portal to upload new docs themselves.
4. RAMS auto-drafted from project + subcontractor data, reviewed and issued from JPMS.
5. CIS verification integrated with HMRC; status held against the record.

## JPMS functionality required

- Subcontractor master record.
- Document register with expiry tracking and reminders.
- Subcontractor self-service portal.
- RAMS template engine populated from project + subcontractor data.
- HMRC CIS integration — or status field with audit if no integration.

---

## Integrations & adjacent systems

- **HMRC CIS service**.
- **RAMsApp** (legacy migration only).
- **Client portals** where required (Dwellant / Vantify).

---

## Acceptance criteria — "done looks like"

- No subcontractor works on a project with expired documents.
- RAMS produced in minutes from existing data, not redrafted each time.
- CIS status is current and visible at the point of payment.

## Open questions

- [ ] HMRC CIS — API available, or scraping/manual?
- [ ] Document expiry grace — soft block (warn) or hard block (no work) at expiry?
- [ ] RAMS approval — client-side approval needed before subcontractor mobilises?
