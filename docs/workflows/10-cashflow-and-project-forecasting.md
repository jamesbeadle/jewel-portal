# Workflow 10 — Cashflow & Project Forecasting

**Group:** Project lifecycle (output)
**Purpose:** Produce a live cashflow forecast for the project portfolio, built **purely from JPMS project data** — work-order commitments, expected valuations per Claim Period, predicted completion %s, and retention timing. One of the two primary outputs of JPMS (the other is the Programme Valuation Report from workflow 05).
**Trigger:** Continuous — refreshed whenever upstream project data changes (new work order, approved variation, valuation issued, site % updated, timesheet approved).
**Frequency:** Live; daily review; weekly deep dive.
**Owner (target):** Finance Director (review and judgement); JPMS for the data assembly.
**Status:** Draft

## Scope rule for this workflow

The cashflow forecast in JPMS is built from **project data inside JPMS only**. It does **not** pull from Xero, Brightpay, Dext, or any accountancy system. The forecast is the JPMS view of what the project portfolio is going to bring in (approved AR-eligible valuations) and what it's going to cost (work-order commitments, approved timesheets, retention). The accountancy team uses this forecast plus their own ledger view to manage actual cash — that bookkeeping work is downstream and outside JPMS.

---

## Current state

1. FD rebuilds the cashflow tracker in Excel weekly from scattered sources (Xero balances, Brightpay payroll runs, the FD's mental model of project commitments).
2. Cross-entity charges between BB / PS / PFP are reconciled manually in a separate sheet.
3. Management view exists only in the FD's head until the Excel is updated.

---

## Target flow

1. **Live forecast assembled from JPMS data alone:**
   - **Forward commitments out** — open work orders by expected payment date (workflow 03), retention release dates from open close-outs (workflow 07), open subcontractor day-rate hours not yet invoiced (workflow 09).
   - **Forward income in** — Programme Valuation Report draft for the next Claim Period (workflow 05), approved variations awaiting client sign-off (workflow 04), settlement payments at project close (workflow 11).
   - **Completion-% prediction** — combines site-reported % (workflow 06) with timesheet-vs-budget burn rate (workflow 09) to give an expected close date per project.
2. **Cross-entity flag** on every commitment and expected income line so a consolidated and per-entity view both work.
3. **FD view** — full dashboard with drill-down to the underlying project record.
4. **Directors / MD view** — scoped read with the same totals, no drill-down into individual subcontractor data.
5. **Architect / Client view (where contract provides)** — scoped to their own project: programme valuation, completion %, expected close.

## JPMS functionality required

- Forecast engine that assembles forward commitments out and forward income in from workflows 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 09, 11.
- Cross-entity flag on every commitment and income line.
- Completion-% prediction model — site-reported % blended with timesheet burn rate.
- Three scoped dashboards: FD (full), Directors / MD (scoped), Architect / Client (per project, optional).
- Snapshot per Claim Period so a historical series is retained.

---

## Inputs (all from JPMS)

- Work-order register (workflow 03) — expected payment dates and amounts.
- Approved variations (workflow 04) — adds to expected income / commitments.
- Programme Valuation Report (workflow 05) — current and next Claim Period.
- Site reports (workflow 06) — completion % per BoQ section.
- Defect register and retention timing (workflow 07).
- Approved timesheets (workflow 09) — labour burn vs cost-code budget.
- Settlement records (workflow 11) — final values at project close.

## Outputs (consumed downstream)

- **Accountancy team** uses the forecast alongside their Xero ledger view to manage actual cash, run AP / AR, and time payment runs. That bookkeeping work is outside JPMS.
- **Directors / MD** read the dashboard directly in JPMS.
- **Client (where contract provides)** sees the project-scoped slice.

## User stories

| ID | Role | Story | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| US-10-01 | P06 Finance Director | As a Finance Director, I want a live 13-week rolling cashflow dashboard built from JPMS project data alone, so that I'm no longer rebuilding it in Excel every week. | Drafted |
| US-10-02 | P06 Finance Director | As a Finance Director, I want to filter the cashflow view by entity (BB / PS / PFP / Consolidated), so that the view matches the question I'm asking. | Drafted |
| US-10-03 | P06 Finance Director | As a Finance Director, I want every commitment and expected income line to carry a cross-entity flag at source, so that cross-entity charges are accurate without month-end correction. | Drafted |
| US-10-04 | P06 Finance Director | As a Finance Director, I want an items-needing-attention queue (sliding completion %, shifting WO payment dates, late valuations, pending retention release), so that my attention goes to the exceptions instead of the whole portfolio. | Drafted |
| US-10-05 | P06 Finance Director | As a Finance Director, I want to drill from a forecast number into the underlying project record in one click, so that I can investigate the root of a movement without leaving the dashboard. | Drafted |
| US-10-06 | P06 Finance Director | As a Finance Director, I want a stress-test slider — "what if completion % slips by N%?" or "what if the next valuation is approved a week late?" — that re-runs the projection without changing source data, so that I can model risk in the moment. | Drafted |
| US-10-07 | JPMS (system) | As JPMS, I want a snapshot of the cashflow forecast retained per Claim Period, so that historical comparison is possible later. | Drafted |
| US-10-08 | JPMS (system) | As JPMS, I want completion-% prediction to blend site-reported % (workflow 06) with timesheet-vs-budget burn rate (workflow 09), so that the forecast reflects both reported and observed progress. | Drafted |
| US-10-09 | P07 Directors / MD | As a Director, I want a scoped dashboard with the same totals as the FD but no FD-level intervention controls, so that I can read the cash position any time without asking the FD. | Drafted |
| US-10-10 | P01 Architect | As an architect / client (where the contract provides), I want a project-scoped view that mirrors the in-team view of valuation, completion % and expected close, so that I have the same picture they do. | Drafted |
| US-10-11 | P03 Project & Commercial Lead | As a Project & Commercial Lead, I want to see the cashflow slice for my own projects, so that I know where I stand commercially without asking the FD. | Drafted |

Covers spreadsheet row 32 (track in-house costs and cross-charge costs between entities / projects).

## Acceptance criteria — "done looks like"

- The cashflow forecast is a live dashboard built from JPMS data, not an Excel rebuild.
- Forecast accuracy improves because completion % is real, not guessed.
- Cross-entity views (consolidated / per-entity) are accurate without month-end manual correction.
- Directors view the cash position any time without asking the FD.

## Open questions

- [ ] Forecast horizon — 13-week rolling? Longer for some audiences?
- [ ] Completion-% prediction model — purely site-reported, purely timesheet-vs-budget, or a blend? Affects forecast accuracy.
- [ ] Cross-entity reporting — separate dashboards per entity, or one consolidated view with filters?
- [ ] Architect / Client scoped view — opt-in per contract, or default for all client-facing projects?
- [ ] Snapshot cadence — does JPMS retain a full forecast snapshot per Claim Period for historical comparison?
