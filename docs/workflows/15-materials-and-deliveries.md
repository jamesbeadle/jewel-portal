## Current state

1. Site/team request comes in by WhatsApp / email / phone.
2. Coordinator contacts suppliers for quotes.
3. Order placed via supplier website or email.
4. Delivery tracked manually; team reminded of incoming items.
5. Goods checked on arrival; issues flagged.

## Target flow (post-automation)

1. Request raised in JPMS by site or office, tied to a project where applicable.
2. Approved suppliers and current pricing available in the JPMS supplier directory.
3. Order placed (manual or via supplier integration where possible); reference held in JPMS.
4. Delivery date and status tracked against the request.
5. Goods-in confirmed on the app; discrepancies raised back to the supplier.

- [ ] Stock items — does JPMS track office stock, or just orders?
