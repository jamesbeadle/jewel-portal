# Workflow 04 — Variations, RFIs & Delays (in-flight changes)

**Group:** Project lifecycle
**Purpose:** Track and formalise the three main change events on an active project: variations, RFIs, and delay notices.
**Trigger:** Architect instruction, client change, site issue, design clash, or programme impact identified.
**Frequency:** Weekly per active project; total cycle ~15 events/month across portfolio.
**Owner (target):** Project & Commercial Lead (review/approve); JPMS for capture, register and issuance.
**Current monthly hours:** ~25 h/month.
**Status:** Draft
**Last reviewed:** —
**Sourced from:** [`/docs/meetings/2026-05-20-jbb-workflow-audit.md`](../meetings/2026-05-20-jbb-workflow-audit.md)

## Current state

1. Three separate Excel logs maintained per project: variation register, RFI register, delay notices.
2. **Variation:** PM identifies, estimates impact, prices, emails for approval, updates Excel.
3. **RFI:** PM identifies gap on drawing, drafts question in Excel, emails architect, chases.
4. **NoD (Notice of Delay):** PM identifies impact, drafts a Word template, issues by email, updates Excel.
5. All three connect loosely to programme and valuation but require manual reconciliation.

## Target flow (post-automation)

1. All three events raised through a single "project change" entry point in JPMS.
2. System classifies the event type and routes to the right template/workflow.
3. **Variation:** priced against the rate library, attached to a BoQ line, approval requested in-system. **If the variation requires a subcontractor price**, JPMS hands off to workflow 03: a bid package is auto-assembled from the variation's BoQ items and drawings, issued to relevant subcontractors, quotes returned, comparison and award handled there. On award, the resulting Work Order is linked back to the originating variation, and the variation's status moves from "pricing" to "awarded — awaiting client approval".
4. **RFI:** question goes to architect via JPMS portal or email-with-link; reply attaches automatically.
5. **Delay notice:** programme impact captured, formal letter auto-drafted from data, PM reviews and issues.
6. All three update programme and valuation automatically once approved (no manual rekey).
7. **Reports** — the unified register surfaces a **Variation Orders list** report (status, value, client approval state, linked WO) which is the canonical VO view for client / CA / Director consumption. Sibling to the Programme Valuation Report in workflow 05.

## JPMS functionality required

- Project change register (unified).
- Variation pricing against the BoQ rate library.
- **Variation-to-bid-package handoff** into workflow 03 with the variation's BoQ items pre-populated; bid package and resulting Work Order link back to the originating variation.
- RFI workflow with architect portal / email-link.
- NoD letter generator from project data.
- Approval routing (PM → client/CA).
- Automatic feed into programme (workflow 05) and valuation (workflow 05) once approved.
- **Variation Orders list report** with filters by status (drafted / pricing / awarded / approved / rejected / settled), value, claim period, subcontractor.

---

## Integrations & adjacent systems

- **Email** (external CAs/architects).
- **Programme module** (internal — workflow 05).
- **Valuation module** (internal — workflow 05).

---

## Acceptance criteria — "done looks like"

- Variations, RFIs and NoDs all live in JPMS, not standalone Excel logs.
- Approved variations automatically appear on the next valuation.
- Variations that need a subcontractor price route through workflow 03 in one click and the resulting Work Order remains linked to the originating variation.
- The Variation Orders list report is the single source of truth for VO status across the project portfolio.
- Architect responses arrive in JPMS, not in an inbox.

## Roles involved (RBAC)

| Role | Involvement |
|---|---|
| Project & Commercial Lead | Owner — raises, prices, routes for approval |
| Architect / CA (external) | Approver — RFI replies and variation sign-off |
| Subcontractor (external) | Source — many RFIs originate from site |
| Finance Director | Read — visibility on commercial impact |

---

## Open questions

- [ ] Approval thresholds — does the MD/Director approve variations above a value?
- [ ] RFI chase cadence — how many days before auto-reminder, and to whom?
- [ ] NoD format — single template, or per-contract?
