## Current state

1. FD chases timesheets from site team and managers.
2. Adjustments (starter, leaver, bonus, expenses) collected by email.
3. FD enters into Brightpay manually.
4. Reviewed and approved by directors.
5. Run, paid, payslips issued.

## Target flow (post-automation)

1. Timesheets captured automatically via site app (workflow 06).
2. Starter/leaver events from HR workflow (16) trigger payroll changes automatically.
3. Brightpay populated from JPMS data; FD reviews exceptions only.
4. Approval workflow within JPMS; pay-run executed in Brightpay.
