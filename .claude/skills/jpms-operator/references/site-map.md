# JPMS site map — every page, what it does, what's done elsewhere

Routes are as the Blazor router spells them; `{project}` is the picked project's
id. Legacy aliases are noted — they still land (labels move, slugs don't).

## Standing work queues

### Control Centre — `/control-centre` (alias `/requests/triage`)
The live mailbox intake queue and router for ALL correspondence across every
project — the projects mailbox read in place; triage only adds or removes
category tags, nothing ever moves. Two-window workspace with panes on an icon
rail: Inbox (Queue / Tagged tabs), Email + read-only mirror, System Tags,
System Actions, Records, Xero, Subcontractor Comms, Outbox, Compose, Preview.
The triage bar holds the selected email's project (auto-matched where possible),
two mandatory Yes/No decisions — **Relevant Event for Programme** and **Entire
thread** — an armable Discard, and ONE **Apply** button that lands everything
staged (tags, new records, to-dos, replies and forwards, "Send to document
triage" ticks) in a single act. Unfinished work parks per email as a draft.
Records (RFIs, defects, variations, bid packages, to-dos) can be raised from an
email in System Actions; the New email composer for any fresh outbound email
also lives here. Attachment filing is NOT done here — the "Send to document
triage" tick copies files to `/document-triage`.

### Document Triage — `/document-triage` (alias `/document-control`)
The attachment triage queue for all projects: each item is a point-in-time copy
of one email attachment ticked over from the Control Centre. Left: Queue /
Filed / Discarded tabs. Right: preview (PDF/images inline), collapsible source
email, and the filing form with three destinations — **Drawings** (new drawing
or revision, code/revision/title prefilled from the filename, lands as an
unapproved revision), **Payment certificate** (project, optional valuation
claim, number, amount, issued date), **Subcontractor document** (subcontractor,
kind, expiry). Discard is restorable, never a delete. Emails themselves are
triaged in the Control Centre; a filed drawing's approval follows the normal
drawings workflow.

### Xero Cost Allocation — `/finance/allocation`
The workbench reconciling Xero with the projects: every cost-of-sales purchase
line (nominal accounts starting 3) is allocated to a project and master cost
centre, or split across several. Tabs: Unallocated, one per project, Allocated,
Buckets, Disputed, Ignored; per-row Allocate / Set / Split… / Allocate to
bucket / Ignore / Dispute…, bulk bars, "Allocate all matched" banner, Sync from
Xero, Re-check matches, search, Excel export. Allocating every line of a draft
bill confirms its Sites/Cost Code tracking to Xero **and approves the bill**.

### Valuation Report — `/projects/{project}/valuation`
The picked project's LIVE valuation report — the system's flagship output,
internal only (clients only ever receive frozen snapshots). Work runs in
monthly claims; the claim card's stepper is **Value & lock → Claim → Approve →
Invoice → Paid → Confirm & roll over**, one primary button per stage, with an
Actions menu for rename, reopen, record rejection/payment, issue without
approval, delete. Lines are added/edited while the claim is Draft; Valuation
Invoices and Snapshots sections sit inline; working-copy PDF/Excel exports
always available. Approving variations — which writes their lines here —
happens on the variation record, not here.

## Project folder

### RFI register — `/projects/{project}/requests`
The project's RFIs (contractual response-due dates) with legacy General
requests one tab behind (requests are being sunset — nothing raises a new one).
Tabs RFIs/Requests, Active/Closed/All chips, free-text search. Actions: Raise
RFI (manual, no email behind it), Excel export, row status chip, tick RFIs →
"Prepare email drafts" (one Outlook draft each from the projects mailbox, PDF
attached — sent from Outlook, never here), merge exactly two open General
requests. Most RFIs are raised from emails in the Control Centre.

### Request / RFI detail — `/projects/{project}/requests/view/{requestId}`
One request's full working papers: detail, official form (itemised queries,
basis, response/action, impact-if-late), response, attachments, tagged email
conversation, audit history; Request and Official-form panes (deep-link
`?tab=official`). Status pill dropdown; Email button (Outlook draft — fresh or
reply-all into the tagged chain, PDF attached); Promote to RFI; Actions menu:
record response, close (date + agent gate), edit subject/dates/description/
official form, critical-path tag, create bid packages, return to Control
Centre, delete (admin). "Find & tag emails" adds correspondence. The Create
Variation Order Quote form (variation_draft) opens here.

### Variation Orders — `/projects/{project}/variations` (alias `…/requests/variations`)
The variation book — one row per variation (ref, title, originating request,
status, value, dates, work orders), search, Excel export. Ladder: Quoting →
Issued → Awaiting AI → Approved/Rejected; **only Approved writes value onto the
valuation report**. Status chip moves side-effect-free stages directly; Approve
and post-approval transitions link to the variation itself; pre-approval
Rejected confirms first (terminal). Subcontractor variation requests are
accepted (creating a variation) or rejected here; approved variations with a
selected sub get "Issue WO". "Add variation manually" (manual_variation) for a
standalone variation. RFI-led drafting happens on the request page.

### Variation detail — `/projects/{project}/variations/{id}` (alias `…/voq/{id}`)
One variation document through the ladder, with the official Variation Order
PDF (scope, commercial basis, programme impact, exclusions — all editable in
place). Status pill moves free stages; "Approved…" opens the approve modal
where priced lines (one per cost centre) are built and written to the Valuation
Report, CVR and budgets; post-approval: Edit lines, Revise value, Issue work
order, Return to quoting (un-approve), Reject (reverses the writes). "Record
agreed tender" captures the chosen sub and value pre-approval; an Awaiting-AI
banner shows whether an Architect's Instruction is linked. Communications panel
reads tagged mail with reply/forward and "Find & tag emails".

### Architect's Instructions — `/projects/{project}/architect-instructions`
Register of formal AIs — the written authority a variation at Awaiting AI needs
before approval. Instructions arrive by email (imported from the attachment) or
are filed via "File an instruction": architect's own reference, date, title,
issuing architect's email, notes, optional document ("Awaited" until it
arrives), tick-boxes for the variations covered (Awaiting-AI first). One
instruction routinely covers several variations. Rows link to variations,
offer Link/Unlink, the stored document, Delete (variations survive).

### Valuation Snapshots — `/projects/{project}/valuation-snapshots`
Read-only register of frozen valuation report snapshots — what the client was
actually sent. A snapshot freezes automatically when a valuation invoice is
raised, and again on submit/issue after an amendment; superseded rows stay,
muted. Row click opens the frozen report; branded PDF download; Email button
(report-running roles) drafts the report to the client from the shared mailbox
— nothing sends from this page. Managing invoices/snapshots is done on the
Valuation Report tab.

### Drawings — `/projects/{project}/drawings`
Drawing register with revisions: each row a drawing with latest approved
revision, pending/archived counts, pipeline status, "ambiguous" badge for
uploads that couldn't auto-classify (`…/drawings/ambiguous` is the queue,
reached by URL). Approved-only toggle; "+ Upload drawing" (Admin/MD/PM); Excel
export. Incoming drawing files from correspondence are filed here from Document
Triage, not uploaded here. Detail page (`…/drawings/{drawingId}`): revision
history + inline viewer, "+ Upload new version", Delete drawing (permanent).

### Programme — `/projects/{project}/programme`
Four sub-tabs: **Programme** (Gantt against latest baseline, movement banner
when completion slips — banner offers Raise NOD per delay event), **Claims**
(Raise Notice of Delay, Raise Extension of Time, Record LADs claim), **Critical
Path RFIs**, **Relevant Events** (emails tagged to the project's scheduling
bucket, read live; "Reply in thread" creates a reply-all Outlook draft). Add
task / Add dependency / Baselines build the programme. Emails become Relevant
Events in the Control Centre; an RFI is marked critical path on its own page.

### To-do — `/projects/{project}/todos` and master `/todos`, detail `/todos/{id}`
Project list and company-wide master (project filter; MD/admin see everything,
others see items for a role they hold minus items pinned to someone else).
Board (drag Open↔Done) or List views; "Add to-do" modal (project blank =
company-wide, MD/admin only; title, assignee, due date, notes). Detail page:
Mark done/Reopen, armed Delete, reassign (role, optionally pinned to a person),
move (project / company-wide), linked to-dos via shared tagged mail, tagged
emails read live and answerable, new outbound email filed to the item. To-dos
from an email are staged in the Control Centre.

### Progress — `/projects/{project}/progress`
Client-facing progress reports assembled from progress updates (titled photo
groups with description, work date, recorded weather). "+ New report" / Edit;
Download PDF (regenerated on every download); "+ Record progress"; photos
added/deleted; two-click deletes.

### Defects — `/projects/{project}/defects`
Defect register — each defect's sequential **DEF-####** reference is also its
mailbox tag stem, so tagged mail reads back live under it. "Raise defect"
inline form (location, assigned-to email, description); Status dropdown walks
Open → In progress → Resolved → Verified; "Emails" expands a row to its tagged
correspondence. Also raised from a subcontractor email in the Control Centre
(System Tags → Create new → Defect); further tagging happens there too.

### Communications — `/projects/{project}/communications`
Roll-up of ALL correspondence tagged to this project's records, read live,
newest first. Pathway filter (Client / Subcontractor / Internal) and "Tagged
to" record-type dropdown; Reply/Forward opens the composer above the list —
sending happens there and then from the projects mailbox, and the sent copy
files back by the thread's tags. Tagging and new emails: Control Centre.

### Useful Information — `/projects/{project}/useful-information`
Titled free-text internal notes — door codes, key safes, site access. API-gated
to internal roles; can never reach a client, architect or subcontractor login.

### Project Settings — `/projects/{project}/settings`
Four panes: Details (stage, entity, PM, client, site address, Xero "Sites"
mapping — "Not set" blocks the Xero write-back), Deposits/retentions/valuation
(next valuation date, retention profile), Contract (executed document + terms),
Correspondence (the profile that routes documents the project issues).

### Projects — `/projects`
Portfolio register (reference, name, client, entity, stage), completed hidden
unless "Show completed". "+ New project" (MD/PM) — though projects normally
come from a won lead; Excel export. `/projects/{project}` bare = redirect to
the role's first tab; always link a specific tab.

## Subcontractor folder

### Bid Package Invites — `/projects/{project}/bid-package-invites`
Register of the project's bid packages (title, trade, status; closed sort
last). "New bid package" (Admin/MD/PM): title + trade → Draft → straight to
detail. "Suggest bid packages": AI reads the live valuation report and proposes
trade packages for remaining works; ticked suggestions become Drafts. Excel
export. All build-out happens on the detail page.

### Bid package detail — `/projects/{project}/bid-package-invites/{id}`
Five tabs: **Details** (specification summary + line schedule, edited together
in one "Edit details" dialog; lines link to a cost centre or a variation),
**Tender list** (add subs from the directory, quick-add, "Find local
subcontractors" web search, Invite email composer — sends from the projects
mailbox, tenderers in BCC, standard T&C PDF auto-attached), **Submissions**
("Extract information" AI-reads a filed tender email against the line
schedule; "Record tender manually"; **Award** — raises the work order),
**Documents**, **Emails** (tagged thread with Reply/Forward).

### Work Orders — `/projects/{project}/work-orders`
Financial roll-up grouped by cost centre or supplier (remembered per user):
committed, paid (from Xero bills), remaining, left to invoice; supplier search;
Excel export. "Add work order" raises a manual order (same modal edits one);
drafts await two-click **Approve** (mints the next WO number and emails the PO
from the projects mailbox) or Reject (terminal). Issued lines offer PO
(printable page), Re-code (move/split across cost centres without changing
value) and Cancel (MD/FD only; refused while bills linked or money paid).
Awarding a tender happens on the bid package; invoice linking on WO Allocation.

### Purchase order — `/projects/{project}/work-orders/{id}/po`
The printable PO as issued: supplier and site addresses, approver, payment
terms, status pill (Draft / Awaiting supplier acceptance / Accepted / Rejected
/ Cancelled). "Print / save PDF"; "Draft email to supplier" (Outlook draft in
the shared mailbox; hidden for draft/rejected/cancelled). Record-keeping
attachments panel below never prints or goes to the supplier.

### WO Allocation — `/projects/{project}/work-order-allocation`
Ties each Xero purchase line to the work order it pays: headline cards (cost of
sales, linked, not linked, fully invoiced); expand an order to unlink a slice;
in the invoice-line queue pick the paying order or split a line (options that
can't take its value disabled). Linking recodes the whole order to the
invoice's cost centre; an order can never be invoiced past its value. Unlinked
lines count as non-work-order cost of sales on Financials.

### Subcontractor portal — `/portal`, `/portal/work-orders/{id}`
The external login's home ("My record"): a subcontractor invited from their
directory entry signs in scoped to their own company's data — their work
orders and documents. Internal users never land here; subcontractors land here
instead of `/dashboard`.

### Subcontractor communications — `/subcontractors/communications`
Every email tagged with the SubComms family (general + Chaser / Info request /
Materials / H&S categories), read live, newest first, category chip filter.
Expand to full body; Reply/Forward send from the projects mailbox in place, the
sent copy inheriting the thread's tags. Tagging/untagging: Control Centre.

## Internal folder

### Directory — `/directory`, entry `/directory/{subcontractorId}`
Unified directory: chips for Clients, Architects, Subcontractors (default),
Internal staff. Subcontractors: search, Type filter, "+ Add company"
(Admin/MD/FD), "Import from Xero", Consolidate (pick master, winning value per
field; references re-point). Clients/Architects render read-only with links to
`/clients` and `/architects` where creation/editing lives. Entry page: company
and contacts, Xero-link badge (name should exactly match the Xero supplier so
invoices line up on WO Allocation), trades against the curated list, contact
Purposes (Accounts/Projects/Estimating/Site), "Invite to portal" (scoped
login), statement of account (every WO with invoices claimed against it — PDF
or email draft).

### Registers — `/registers` · Policies — `/policies`
Registers: the Monday replacement — insurances, subscriptions, vans, trade
accounts. Policies: staff sign-off forms (NDAs, policies, H&S acknowledgements).

### Architects — `/architects` · Clients — `/clients`
Practice/account registers; the contact email held here is where a project's
request documents go when that party is on the project. New/Edit/Contacts
buttons, Excel export.

## Time folder

### Labour — `/projects/{project}/labour`
Weekly timesheet approval grid + daily site register + subcontractor
settlement. Prev/Next week; tick and bulk-approve submitted rows (**only
approved time posts to Financials as cost**; per-cost-code budget hard-block
server-side), Adjust (half-hour steps, re-code) or Reject with a reason the
worker sees; manual-entry form for missed sign-outs; assign/remove workers;
"Mark invoice lines as covered…" reconciles Xero invoice lines against
approved timesheet cost; Excel exports. Workers log time on My day.

### Workers — `/labour/workers`
Company-wide registry of day-rate operatives with cost rates. Add/Edit modal
(name, portal email, day rate stored as hourly = day rate ÷ 8, phone, linked
subcontractor, Active toggle); a worker with history can only be deactivated.
Rate changes apply to future approvals only — approved timesheets keep their
snapshotted rate. `/labour/overview` is the cross-project labour view;
`/labour/xero-mapping` maps labour to Xero.

## Finance folder

### Project Financials — `/projects/{project}/financials`
The cost ledger by cost centre: contract sales value, % complete, target cost,
committed WOs, actual cost of sales (Xero spend from `/finance/allocation`),
drawdown/overspend by sign, forecasted cost of sales. Figures click through to
modals (valuation lines, work orders, invoices — an invoice can be linked to a
WO or moved between centres); edit cost % complete inline; lock finalised lines
(realising drawdown to P/L); roll rows into named groups; reconciliation
packages below.

### Payment Certificates — `/finance/payment-certificates`
Company-wide register grouped by project (live-work order) with certified
totals: certificate number, issued date, the valuation claim certified, amount,
file (PDF preview / download). Only control is the project filter. Certificates
arrive filed from Document Triage.

### Cost Codes — `/cost-codes`
The global cost-centre master everything groups by. Tabs: Our cost codes (New,
Edit, Retire/Reinstate — retired codes keep history; Excel export), Xero sites
and Xero cost codes (tracking-category options exactly as Xero holds them,
Refresh from Xero). Use exact spellings from here rather than guessing.

### Rates — `/rate-library`, `/rate-library/stale`
Read-only rate library by trade (description, supplier, unit, rate,
last-priced; header counts stale = not priced in 60+ days). Stale page lists
what to re-price before the next tender.

## Financial Reports folder

### Project Cashflow — `/projects/{project}/cashflow`
The project's to-completion cash statement: project claim, cash allocated
(received + retention held), left to claim, then cash still to move (cost
centre drawdowns, uninvoiced WOs, unpaid purchase invoices) through retention
releases 1 and 2 to practical/project completion totals. Cards for overspends
available to buy back and (dashed) potential from unapproved variations.
Read-only — inputs edited on Financials, the valuation report, Settings
(retention terms) and `/finance/allocation`.

### Cash Forecast — `/finance/cash-forecast` (aliases `/finance`, `/finance/cash-summary`)
Company time-phased forecast: every known future cash movement in its expected
month; directors-only KPI strip and closing-bank-balance row seeded from Xero,
lowest month flagged. Project multi-select (defaults to live jobs); expand
cash-in/out categories to per-project lines; inline edits: monthly company
overheads default, per-month overrides, and each project's next expected
valuation date + expected monthly valuation. Position to Completion statement
below; Excel export. Phased months tie to each project's Cashflow tab to the
penny.

### Weekly Cashflow — `/finance/weekly-cashflow` (directors + Accounts)
The accountant's live 13-week payment plan, one column per week: every
outstanding Xero bill and sales invoice seeded at its due week (or its Xero
Planned / Expected date), plus manual items Xero can't see (subcontractors,
staff, subscriptions, direct debits, other). Overdue sits in the current week;
Later is beyond the horizon. Directors' tiles: cash in bank, to pay this week,
lowest week, horizon-end balance; Accounts sees to pay this week plus cash
out / cash in over the 13 weeks (the bank position is directors only). Work it with ‹ › on a
cell to move an entry to the week it will really be paid (↺ returns it, ‣
marks a moved entry — moves change WHEN, never HOW MUCH, and are shared);
**Group suppliers** folds chosen suppliers into one line (a group row is one
line; its ‹ › move every bill in that cell); ⊘ parks an entry already covered
elsewhere, struck through and uncounted; **Add item** adds manual outgoings.
Excel export is the grid on paper: **Weekly plan** (one line per supplier,
groups honoured, a column per week, band totals, net movement, directors'
closing balance), **Detail** (every bill under its line with due/expected
dates), **Data** (flat list for pivoting); a shaded amount was moved. Real
payment agreements belong in Xero (bill Planned date / invoice Expected date);
ageing lives on Aged Payables/Receivables. Over the connector:
`get_weekly_cashflow_grid` returns this grid line by line (includeEntries for
the bills behind a line), `get_weekly_cashflow_plan` the raw overlay, and the
`*_weekly_cashflow_*` actions the writes.

### Profit Summary — `/finance/profit-summary`
Gross profit by project three ways: running % by month end (Xero site P&L,
invoiced basis), summary tiles (budgeted, forecast, biggest swing vs the
deal), budget→forecast bridge, and the banded table (deal as signed, current
position — certified vs allocated Xero spend, to finish, forecast at
completion). Refresh re-pulls the stored Xero site P&L. Certified-basis table
and invoiced-basis panels deliberately differ.

## Xero folder

### Xero Transactions — `/finance/xero`
Purchase invoices read live from Xero with site and cost code per line. Views:
Transactions (search, status chips, expandable lines) and Site × cost code
(net-spend pivot per calendar year on the accountant's basis: paid, authorised
or awaiting approval, minus credit notes; drafts excluded). Refresh from Xero,
Excel export; banner when the fetch cap truncates. Coding happens on
`/finance/allocation`.

### Aged Receivables / Aged Payables — `/finance/aged-receivables`, `/finance/aged-payables`
Aged exactly as Xero ages them but **including drafts** — the only complete
picture, since the accounting procedure leaves bills in draft until coded
through the portal. Tiles (total, draft slice, overdue); one row per
client/supplier expanding to invoices/bills with Draft and Credit badges;
ageing toggle due date ↔ invoice date; Refresh, Excel export. Read-only.

## Audit folder

- **Reconciliation Audit** — `/projects/{project}/reconciliation-audit`: every
  cost-centre recode of a valuation report line, newest first — who, which
  line, from/to, value; the record finance reconciles against. Read-only.
- **System Audit Trail** — `/audit`: append-only register of who routed,
  linked and filed what; pathway tabs, event-type and project filters; "Open
  in Outlook" links to drafted emails.
- **Agent Activity** — `/agents/activity`: every assistant run — when, agent,
  who it ran as ("unattended" = nobody watching), action, outcome, tools,
  duration, tokens, cost; totals. Distinct from `/agents` (the queue of
  requests being watched by applied discipline agents — applied FROM a request
  page) and `/admin/agents` (the registry).

## Admin folder

- **Users** — `/admin/users` (+ `/admin/users/revoked`): invites, role
  assignments; revoke → restore or permanent delete from the revoked list.
- **System** — `/admin/system`: "Publish update" raises the refresh bar on
  every signed-in tab after a deploy; Tender T&Cs panel holds the single
  standard T&C PDF auto-attached to every tender-invite email.
- **Trades** — `/admin/trades`: the curated trade list every directory record
  and bid package picks from (delete blocked while in use).
- **AI Agents** — `/admin/agents`: the live agent registry (read-only; config
  is code). **AI Skills** — `/admin/skills`: versioned markdown skills, in
  force on the assistant's next message, no deploy; each save is a new version.

## Off-rail pages

`/rfis` (company-wide read-only RFI register, overdue day-counts in red).
`/dashboard` (alias `/my-day`) is the role-aware home. The CRM front end
(`/estimating-queue`, `/nurture`, `/sales-analytics`) was removed on
2026-09-03 — the leads API and the `list_leads` tool remain, with no page.
