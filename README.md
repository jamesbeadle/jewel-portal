# Jewel Enterprises — Business Platform Scoping

> The living scoping dashboard for the Jewel Enterprises master business platform.
> Everything in this repository is **discovery-phase material**: user journeys, personas, workflows, data models, UI components, and meeting decisions.
> No production code lives here yet. Once journeys are signed off, this material becomes the acceptance criteria for development.

## 1. Project at a Glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Vision** | A master operating system for the business, with projects as the central organising concept. |
| **Working name (initial software)** | **Project Program Scheduler** — manage the program of work for each project from tender through delivery to cash call. |
| **Business context** | Construction. Jewel Enterprises delivers work commissioned by architects. See [`/docs/requirements/glossary.md`](docs/requirements/glossary.md) for domain terms (Tender, RFI, VO, Cash Call, etc.). |
| **Primary goals** | (1) Smooth project management end-to-end. (2) Robust finance workflows tied to projects — **the Accountant's cashflow forecast accuracy is the primary pain point driving scope.** (3) A "second brain" of domain knowledge usable later as an API endpoint by Claude or similar. |
| **Platform** | Progressive Web App (PWA), installable as a desktop/mobile app. |
| **Tech stack** | Blazor (WebAssembly) front-end · ASP.NET Core back-end · Azure hosting · Azure SQL primary database · Microsoft Entra ID for auth · Microsoft Teams / Graph integrations. |
| **Phase** | Discovery & scoping. |
| **Methodology** | User-journey-driven scoping with on-site role-play validation sessions. |

## 2. How This Repo is Organised

```
/docs
  /user-journeys     Markdown journeys + interactive demos (the core artefact)
    /_templates      Reference-only scaffolding
  /ui-components     Atomic-design component library spec
    /_templates      Reference-only scaffolding
  /workflows         BPMN / Mermaid process diagrams
    /_templates      Reference-only scaffolding
  /data-models       JSON Schemas + entity-relationship diagrams
    /_templates      Reference-only scaffolding
  /requirements      Personas, glossary, permission matrix, non-functional requirements
    /_templates      Reference-only scaffolding
  /meetings          Session notes + decisions log
    /_templates      Reference-only scaffolding
/prototypes          Blazor PWA Journey Index + HTML demos (scoping only)
/jpms                JPMS — production Blazor WebAssembly client app (see §11)
/assets              Screenshots, icons, branding
```

Each folder has its own `README.md` explaining its purpose, its `_templates/` reference, and the process for adding real content. Start there before adding new files.

---

## 3. Templates vs project content — the rule

This repository deliberately separates **reference scaffolding** from **confirmed project content**:

- 📁 **`_templates/`** subfolders in every section hold blank templates and worked examples. They exist so we know *what shape* a journey, persona, schema, or component spec should take. **They are reference only.** Nothing in `_templates/` is ever treated as a decision about Jewel Enterprises and should never be quoted in a stakeholder session as if it were.
- 📁 **The section root** (e.g. `/docs/user-journeys/`) holds **real content** only — material that came out of a discovery or role-play session with someone who actually does the work.
- 🔗 **Every real file has a `Sourced from:` line** pointing at the meeting note that captured it. If a file has no source, it's an assumption — not a decision.

When a real journey/persona/component is created, it's copied **from** a template, populated **from** a meeting note, and lives **outside** `_templates/`.

## 6. User Journeys & Workflows

Workflows are the cross-actor process maps from the JBB audit (one per file under [`/docs/workflows/`](docs/workflows/)). Journeys are per-persona slices through those workflows where the actor experience deserves its own walkthrough (under [`/docs/user-journeys/`](docs/user-journeys/)). Status moves left-to-right: Draft → In Review → Confirmed.

## 8. Next Session

- **Date:** _to be confirmed_
- **Attendees:** _to be confirmed_
- **Agenda placeholder:**
  1. Review the draft personas; walk each one with someone in that role where possible.
  2. Resolve the open questions in [`2026-05-18-domain-discovery.md`](docs/meetings/2026-05-18-domain-discovery.md).
  3. Map the **Accountant's cashflow-forecast journey** first — it drives the whole platform's design.
  4. Pick the next two journeys to deep-dive.

Create the meeting note in `/docs/meetings/` from the template **before** the session.

---

## 9. Conventions

- **File names:** lower-kebab-case, with a numeric prefix for ordering where it helps (`01-`, `02-`).
- **Markdown only** for narrative content. Diagrams in Mermaid where possible (renders natively on GitHub).
- **JSON Schema (draft 2020-12)** for entity definitions. Schemas live in `/docs/data-models/` and are referenced by journeys.
- **One PR per journey** during deep-dive sessions, so reviews stay focused.
- **Confirmation Checklist** at the bottom of every journey file — a journey is not "Confirmed" until that checklist is ticked by the actor.
- **`Sourced from:`** line on every real artefact, pointing at the meeting note behind it.
- **`_templates/` is reference only** — never quoted, never linked from real content as a source.

## 11. Production — JPMS (Jewel Project Management System)

> Scoping happens in `/docs` and `/prototypes`. The **actual product** is being built in [`/jpms`](jpms/README.md).
> Read this section before touching anything in that folder.

### 11.1 What JPMS is

**JPMS — Jewel Project Management System** — is the production web app the company and its clients will use day-to-day. It's a multi-tenant Blazor WebAssembly PWA. Each Jewel client (architect firms, QSs, subcontractors, the internal team) signs in with their own work identity and sees only the projects they belong to.

Working name from the scoping repo is *Project Program Scheduler*; the product brand is **JPMS**.

### 11.2 Where it differs from `/prototypes`

| | `/prototypes/journey-index` | `/jpms` |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Scoping & role-play walkthroughs | The real product |
| Audience | Internal stakeholders during discovery sessions | Jewel staff + external clients |
| Lifetime | Disposable | Long-lived |
| Auth | None | Microsoft + Google sign-in, gated by an internal directory |
| Data | Hard-coded in `.cs` files | ASP.NET Core API + Azure SQL (to be added) |

The two share a deliberate **visual language** — slate palette, rounded cards, same typography stack — so design learnings from the prototype carry over without rework.

### 11.3 Tech stack

- **Front-end:** Blazor WebAssembly · .NET 8 LTS · Tailwind (CDN today, CLI build before launch)
- **PWA:** installable on desktop and mobile, theme `#0f172a`
- **Auth (target):** Microsoft Entra ID (MSAL) + Google Identity Services
- **Back-end (next):** ASP.NET Core Web API · Azure SQL · Microsoft Graph integrations
- **Hosting:** Azure Static Web Apps initially, Azure App Service once the API lands

### 11.4 What's built so far

The opening slice — sign-in and approved-user gating — is in place:

- **Landing page** at `/` is the login screen with `Continue with Microsoft` and `Continue with Google` buttons.
- **Dashboard** at `/dashboard` is shown to users on the internal allow-list.
- **Request-access** view is shown to users who sign in successfully but aren't on the allow-list.
- **Mock sign-in:** real OAuth isn't wired yet — the buttons accept any email so we can iterate on the UI first.
- **Hard-coded allow-list** in `jpms/Services/AllowListUserDirectory.cs` controls who reaches the dashboard. Edit that file to test both flows.

### 11.5 Two seams ready for real wiring

The mock layer was designed so each piece can be swapped in isolation:

1. **OAuth** — `AuthService.SignInAsync(...)` is the one method that becomes real OAuth. Add `Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal` for Microsoft, Google Identity Services for Google, and replace the body. Client IDs go in `wwwroot/appsettings.json`.
2. **User directory** — `IUserDirectory` is already the right shape for a backend lookup. A new `HttpUserDirectory : IUserDirectory` calls `/api/users/me` on the ASP.NET Core API; one DI line in `Program.cs` swaps it in.

Both can land as small, focused PRs.

### 11.6 Roadmap (rough)

Re-ordered on 2026-05-20 to reflect the [JBB workflow audit](docs/meetings/2026-05-20-jbb-workflow-audit.md) recommended phasing: finance first (largest current-hour cost and clearest ROI), then project lifecycle (the JPMS core), then everything else.

#### Platform foundations
1. Wire real Microsoft + Google sign-in (Entra ID / MSAL primary).
2. Stand up the ASP.NET Core API and Azure SQL schema.
3. Replace the allow-list with an admin-managed directory.
4. Move hosting from Static Web Apps to App Service once an API is in place.

#### Phase 1 — Finance ROI
Driven by the FD's load (workflows 09 + 13 alone consume ~140 h/month today).

5. **Workflow 11 — Cashflow & Management Reporting** — the primary pain-point anchor from [2026-05-18](docs/meetings/2026-05-18-domain-discovery.md). Journey [11a](docs/user-journeys/11a-fd-cashflow-forecast.md) is the first deep-dive.
6. **Workflow 09 — Accounts Payable** — single largest workflow (~80 h/mo). Journey [09a](docs/user-journeys/09a-fd-ap-exception-review.md).
7. **Workflow 10 — Accounts Receivable** — closes the loop with valuations and cashflow.
8. **Workflow 13 — Accounts Inbox Triage** — ~60 h/mo today. Journey [13a](docs/user-journeys/13a-fd-inbox-triage-exceptions.md).

#### Phase 2 — JPMS project-lifecycle core
9. **Workflow 03 — Subcontractor Procurement** (~35 h/mo). Journey [03a](docs/user-journeys/03a-subcontractor-quote-return.md).
10. **Workflow 04 — Variations / RFIs / Delays** (~25 h/mo). Journey [04a](docs/user-journeys/04a-architect-rfi-response.md). Now includes explicit VO → bid-package loop into workflow 03.
11. **Workflow 01 — Drawing Receipt & Distribution** (~15 h/mo).
12. **Workflow 05 — Programme & Valuations** — feeds workflow 10 AR. Now produces a named **Programme Valuation Report** per **Claim Period**, with a sibling Variation Orders list.
13. **Workflow 06 — Site Reporting & Progress** — feeds workflow 05 and workflow 12. Journey [06a](docs/user-journeys/06a-site-team-daily-capture.md).
14. **Workflow 22 — Timesheet Management (cost-code-aware)** — feeds 05 (valuations), 09 (AP for subcontractor day-rate), 11 (cashflow forward commitment), 12 (payroll). Carries the cost-code budget hard-block rule.

#### Phase 3 — Everything else
15. Workflows 02, 07, 08, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 sequenced per stakeholder priority. Journeys [08a](docs/user-journeys/08a-subcontractor-compliance-upload.md) and [16a](docs/user-journeys/16a-coordinator-starter-day-one.md) already drafted.
16. **Workflow 23 — Project Completion Settlement & VAT Analysis** — depends on workflows 03, 05, 07, 09, 22 being in place first. Settles open commercial items at PC, runs zero-rated VAT analysis with client agreement, triggers retention release.

The full phased view (with current-hour cost per workflow) lives in [`docs/workflows/README.md`](docs/workflows/README.md#phased-delivery-from-the-audits-recommended-order).
