/// <summary>
/// The one check on raising a valuation invoice: it is drawn against the project's LATEST claim,
/// that claim is locked ("We're claiming this" — Preapproved), and no live invoice is drawn
/// against it already. The claim card only OFFERS "Raise claim" at that moment; the Valuation
/// Invoices add form and the connector's create_valuation_invoice reach the handler directly, and
/// until 2026-09-07 nothing refused a raise over a Draft claim (a statement frozen from figures
/// still being edited), over a claim the report had already moved past (the snapshot capture
/// freezes the latest claim, so the statement would not be that claim's), or a second live
/// invoice over a claim that already had one. A Confirmed latest claim with no live invoice may
/// still be invoiced — the early-confirm nudge lets a claim be confirmed before its invoice
/// exists. Historic (manual) entries record the past and never pass through here.
