/// <summary>
/// Work Order bill recognition (2026-09-08, the accountant's ask), computed next to labour
/// recognition on every unallocated read: a bill whose supplier has an open work order was
/// decided when the order was approved — project, cost code(s) — so it belongs on the allocation
/// page's Work Order bills tab, pre-filled from the order, not in the queue for a hand decision.
///
/// The rules, decided per BILL: the labour registry wins (a worker's bill is settlement, not a
/// cost — the cover route); then the supplier is resolved to its directory company; then, when
/// the lines name two or more different orders in their descriptions, the bill is proposed as a
/// figure per order — each line's net on the order it names (ByLine, 2026-09-09); else a
/// work-order number written on the bill picks the order — or, naming several, puts the whole
/// bill on the first for the figures to be changed on the card — else a supplier with exactly
/// one open order matches on that alone — else, among several, the amounts decide when they
/// can (2026-09-11: the bill's net is exactly what is left on one order, or on one unique set
/// of them, and those remaining values are the proposed figures) — and when they cannot, the
/// bill goes to the card with every order listed and nothing placed, for the split to be keyed;
/// finally each order's slice must fit inside what is left to invoice on it. The answer is BILL-level: a slice per order, the same match on every
/// line, never a coding of the Xero lines (the supplier's own CIS split, left as raised). An
/// "open" order is Released with value still left to invoice (decision 2026-09-08). Anything
/// that does not match cleanly stays in the queue — with the reason on the row when an order was
/// in play, and silently when none was. A wrong match has the card's "Not a work-order bill". One partial per concern: Rules (the whole-bill
/// decision), ByLine (the per-line rule), Splits (the match shape and the pro rata coding).
