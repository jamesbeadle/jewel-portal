/// A claim entry stores the money as well as the percentage, and that stored money is what the lock
/// freezes into the statement the client is sent (ValuationStatementLines.FreezeAsync) — so
/// leaving it alone after a re-price would issue a figure nobody chose. The percentage is what a
/// QS actually enters and the money is derived from it, so the percentage stays put and the money
/// follows the line, exactly as RecordClaimEntries computes it when the percentage itself is edited.
///
/// Only a Draft claim is touched. Preapproved and Confirmed claims keep the money they were claimed
/// at — that is what the client saw — which is also why a change of VALUE is refused outright while
/// the latest claim is preapproved: its totals are already frozen, so the value under it must not
/// move. Re-shaping a variation's breakdown without changing its total is not a re-price in that
/// sense — every claim's money is dealt across the new lines unchanged (VariationClaimRespread),
/// so ReviseVariationOrderLinesHandler only raises this guard when the total moves.
