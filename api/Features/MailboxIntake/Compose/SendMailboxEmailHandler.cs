/// <summary>
/// Triage compose: stage a draft in the projects mailbox and SEND it (docs: the 2026-08-04 send
/// decision, reversing ADR-006's draft-only rule — see the ADR amendment). One handler covers all
/// three shapes: a reply inside an existing conversation (Graph's createReplyAll supplies the
/// threading headers and quoted history; the composer's envelope then replaces the scaffolding
/// wholesale), a FORWARD of an existing email (Graph's createForward — same scaffolding shape, and
/// Graph carries the original attachments onto the draft itself), and a brand-new outbound email.
/// A forward is passing the email on, not answering it, so it never tags the thread JPMS/Replied;
/// its sent copy still inherits the anchor's record tags (same conversation), so it files itself
/// into a linked record's correspondence exactly like a reply.
///
/// Failure ordering puts the irreversible step last and keeps every failure recoverable:
///   validate → resolve attachments → (optional) raise request → stage draft (+envelope, categories,
///   attachments) → SEND → tag the inbound thread → audit.
/// A failed SEND therefore triages nothing and loses nothing — the reviewed draft stays in Drafts
/// (outcome Sent=false + webLink, so the user can finish in Outlook). A failed tag AFTER a send is
/// visible (the email is still queued, now with a Replied hint) and idempotently retryable. To-dos
/// raised alongside a compose are a separate command the UI runs first — see TriageQueue.
///
/// Replying IS a triage decision (MarkThreadHandled): after a successful send the inbound thread is
/// tagged JPMS/Replied + pathway — unless the compose also filed it to a record (opt-in
/// AlsoRaiseRequest or LinkRecord), whose tag already says more than "replied".
