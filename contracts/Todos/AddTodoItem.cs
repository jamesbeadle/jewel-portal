// Add a single to-do item to a project from the Overview tab. Assignment is to a ROLE (required —
// Miscellaneous when no role owns it), optionally pinned to a named person who holds it — see TodoItem. CreatedByEmail is
// stamped from the signed-in user server-side — never trusted from the client body.
// AboutRecordType/AboutRecordId (both or neither) make the item ABOUT a record on the same
// project — raised from that record's page (a defect's "New to-do"), or by the connector's
// add_todo with aboutRecordType/aboutRecordId. The server checks the record exists and belongs
// to the project.
