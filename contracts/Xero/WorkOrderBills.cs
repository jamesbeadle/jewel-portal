// Work Order bills (2026-09-08, the accountant's ask): a supplier bill from a supplier with an
// open work order was decided when the order was approved — project, cost code(s), the lot. It
// must not wait in Unallocated for someone to re-decide it. The unallocated read matches each
// bill to its order (WorkOrderBillMatch rides the bill's lines), the allocation page shows the
// bill as ONE card pre-filled from the order, and Approve allocates every line, links the order,
// writes the tracking to Xero and approves the bill there in one go. Nobody codes by hand.
//
// Since 2026-09-09 a bill may pay SEVERAL of the supplier's open orders (the accountant's ask:
// one bill, £1,748 to WO-0055 and £1,344 to WO-0056). The split is a figure per order off the
// BILL TOTAL — never off the Xero lines, which are the supplier's own CIS labour/materials
// split and are left exactly as raised. The read proposes the figures (the whole bill on the
// matched order; per order when each line names its own), the card lets them be changed and
// checks they tie to the bill, and Approve spreads each order's slice over the bill's lines
// and each line's portion over the order's cost codes, to the penny, portal-side only.
