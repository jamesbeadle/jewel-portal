// ============================================================================
// Xero ledger allocation — reconciling accounts (Xero) with projects (JPMS).
// Purchase invoice LINES pulled from Xero are stored in JPMS with an
// allocation status; each line is allocated to a JPMS project + master cost
// centre (00001..00137 — deliberately independent of Xero's own tracking
// codes). Syncing upserts by Xero line id: new lines arrive Unallocated and
// existing lines have their Xero facts refreshed without ever touching the
// allocation. A line is allocated to ONE project, but its value can be SPLIT
// across multiple cost centres (Splits — net amounts summing to the line net).
//
// Write-back: bills arrive from Dext as DRAFT. Once every stored line of a
// draft (or submitted) bill is allocated, JPMS writes the allocation back to
// Xero — Sites + Cost Code tracking per line, splitting Xero lines where the
// allocation is split — and approves the invoice (DRAFT → AUTHORISED). Bills
// already approved outside JPMS are still allocated portal-side only.
// ============================================================================

// Disputed (2026-08-14): a cost the director contests, parked in its own bucket while he and the
// accountant talk it through on the allocation page — a message thread per line, coding settable
// mid-dispute, and either side resolves it back into the queue.
