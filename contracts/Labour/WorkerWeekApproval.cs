// The connector's approval leg (2026-08-28, the accountant's ask): code and approve a worker's
// week from an AI session the way the Labour tab does it — same handlers, same gates, same
// uncoded and budget hard-blocks — keyed by worker NAME and dates, because an AI caller never
// holds the grid's opaque timesheet ids. Approval remains final: an approved timesheet's cost
// has posted and its code and hours can no longer be changed, which is why approve carries the
// connector's confirm-first gate.

/// <summary>
/// Applies ONE cost code to a worker's Submitted timesheets in a week on one project — the bulk
/// twin of the grid's per-row Adjust, sharing AdjustTimesheet's handler per row (hours pass
/// through unchanged; approved rows are immutable and report so). Dates narrows the act to
/// specific days; null means every Submitted day of that worker's week on the project.
