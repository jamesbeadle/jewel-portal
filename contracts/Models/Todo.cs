// A to-do item. Created directly on a project's To-do tab, from an email at the triage stage
// (several at once), or as a GENERAL company-wide item that belongs to no project (ProjectId is ""
// then) — captured from a company-wide email at triage or added on the To-dos browser page. Each
// item owns a sequential "TODO-0001" reference which is also its mailbox tag stem, so an email
// tagged "JPMS/TODO-0001" is the item's linked mail — the same live-read link mechanism the
// Request / Bid Package families use.
//
// Items are assigned to a ROLE first (null = unassigned), and OPTIONALLY pinned to a named person
// who holds that role. The role is what makes assignments survive staff changes: everyone holding
// the role sees an unpinned item and may tick it off, and when someone leaves, a new starter
// taking over the role simply inherits the open items. A pin narrows the item to one person's list
// without giving up that safety — a person can only be pinned WITH their role, and if they leave
// the directory (or lose the role) the pin is cleared and the item falls back to the role.

// to price something and the site manager to book access is therefore two independent to-dos
// raised in one action, either completable without closing the other. Empty or null = a single
