// Lifecycle of a valuation invoice (formerly "cash call"). The happy path is one move per
// material stage, driven from the claim card: raised & sent in one click (Raised is a
// transient — a report snapshot is frozen at raise and the claim goes straight to
// Submitted, with the architect/client for approval) → Approved → Issued (client invoice
// sent — counts toward certified/invoiced to date) → Paid (client has paid — rolls into
// the project-level paid total).
// Submitted can come back Rejected, returning the invoice for amendment (→ Raised, now a
// draft state that also covers invoices added directly in the section) or cancellation.
// Raised/Submitted → Issued directly remains permitted for projects that skip the formal
// approval loop.
// Int values 0–2 predate the approval states and are persisted/seeded — never renumber.

// A valuation invoice: the client invoice raised against the current valuation/CVR. Drawn from a
// valuation claim when one is linked. Issued/Paid invoices drive "Certified to date" on the
// valuation report; when paid, the amount rolls into the project-level total. Submitted/Approved
// invoices are pending — they never count toward certified until issued. Manual invoices are
// backdated historical entries created directly as Issued or Paid; they bypass the approval loop.
//
// Amount is the CASH the client is asked to pay. On a deposit project the invoice also carries
// DepositCredited — the cash-up-front deposit credit embedded in it (stamped from the claim's
// outstanding deduction at raise time) — so the GROSS certificate the invoice represents is
// Amount + DepositCredited. Certification runs gross; the deposit credit is a cash-side line.
