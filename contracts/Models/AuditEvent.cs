// What happened, on the record of client-facing interactions. Scope decision 2026-07-22: the audit
// trail records CLIENT-FACING events only — triage decisions on client-pathway threads, client
// records created or linked from email, drafted client correspondence, wall refusals, snapshots.
// Subcontractor/internal event values are reserved (declared, never written yet) so widening the
// scope later is a filter change, not a schema change.
//
// First widening, 2026-07-28: CostCentreRecoded — the finance reconciliation trail. Moving a
// valuation report line between cost centres recodes where money sits in the cost-centre master,
// so each move is recorded (who, when, which line, from → to, the value carried). Not a
// client-facing event: Pathway is "", and the register's client filters simply never match it.
//
// Second widening, 2026-08-04: the link events (EmailTriaged / RecordLinked) are now written for
// EVERY pathway, not just Client — the record activity indicator derives each record's
// recent-communications score from these rows (ListRecordActivity), so links to bid packages,
// work orders and pathway-neutral records must leave a trace too. Pathway carries the thread's
// side ("Subcontractor", "Internal", or "" for neutral links); client-facing views keep filtering
// on it, which is the filter-change-not-schema-change this enum's reserved values planned for.
