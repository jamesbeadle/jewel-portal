/// THE status vocabulary: every domain status maps to one <see cref="Tone"/> here and nowhere

/// colour itself. The rule of thumb applied throughout: Positive = done/approved/healthy,
/// Negative = failed/rejected/overdue, Warning = someone must act, Info = in flight / neutral,
/// Muted = a plain fact (draft, cancelled, closed, withdrawn).
