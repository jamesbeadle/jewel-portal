# JPMS — Jewel Project Management System (Blazor WebAssembly PWA)

The production web app for Jewel Enterprises and its clients. Blazor WebAssembly + Tailwind, hosted on Azure Static Web Apps with Microsoft Entra ID authentication and Azure SQL Serverless for persistence.

## Stack

| Layer | Tech | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| Front-end | Blazor WebAssembly · .NET 8 LTS · PWA | Azure Static Web Apps (Free tier, West Europe) |
| Styling | Tailwind v3 CLI build | compiled at `dotnet publish` time |
| Authentication | Microsoft Entra ID via SWA managed auth (`/.auth/login/aad`) | Static Web Apps |
| Database (next) | Azure SQL Database GP_S_Gen5 Serverless, Free-Limit if available | UK South |

## What's built today

The whole site map's Phase-1 internal scope is shipped as a navigable shell with seeded in-memory data. SQL persistence replaces the in-memory stores in the next layer; nothing in the UI changes.

### Top-level navigation

| Route | Workflow | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | — | Microsoft sign-in landing |
| `/dashboard` | — | Role-aware home (Admin / placeholder / request-access) |
| `/leads` + `/leads/{id}/{tab}` | 00 CRM | Lead pipeline with seven tabs (overview / qualification / site-visits / info-chase / bid-decision / proposal / outcome) |
| `/leads/new` | 00 CRM | Capture-lead form |
| `/estimating-queue` | 00 CRM | QS prioritised queue |
| `/nurture` | 00 CRM | Lost leads kept warm |
| `/sales-analytics` | 00 CRM | Source attribution + win rate |
| `/projects` + `/projects/{id}` | All | Portfolio + project hub with tabbed sub-areas |
| `/projects/{id}/drawings` (+`/{drawingId}`) | 01 Drawings | Drawing register, upload, revision history |
| `/projects/{id}/boq` | 02 BoQ | Line items, direct add, totals |
| `/projects/{id}/procurement` | 03 Procurement | Bid packages + work orders awarded |
| `/projects/{id}/mobilisation` | 04 Mobilisation | Site mobilisation checklist (hard gate) |
| `/projects/{id}/changes` (+`/{kind}`) | 05 Changes | Unified RFI/submittal/variation/NoD register |
| `/projects/{id}/site` | 06 Site | Programme + site reports |
| `/projects/{id}/commercial` | 07 Commercial | CVR snapshot + PVR valuations + cost-code budgets |
| `/projects/{id}/closeout` | 08 Close-out | Defects + settlement + VAT analysis + retention |
| `/subcontractors` + `/subcontractors/{id}` | 03 Procurement | Master directory + per-sub compliance docs |
| `/work-orders` | 03 Procurement | Portfolio-wide WO list (FD view) |
| `/hs` | 04 H&S | Cross-project H&S register (observations, incidents, corrective actions, toolbox talks, permits) |
| `/cashflow` | 07 Cashflow | FD cashflow snapshot (13-week net) |
| `/portfolio` | 09 Portfolio | Director / FD cross-project view (margin, exceptions) |
| `/rate-library` + `/rate-library/stale` | 02 Rates | Rate library and stale-rate queue |

### Auth + admin

| Route | Page | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `/login` | (config) | Redirects to `/.auth/login/aad?post_login_redirect_uri=/dashboard` |
| `/logout` | (config) | Redirects to `/.auth/logout?post_logout_redirect_uri=/` |

The dashboard resolves to one of three states based on `EffectiveRoles.For(email, directoryEntry)`:

The dashboard resolves to one of three states:

| State | When | Renders |
|---|---|---|
| Admin home | Signed-in email is in the directory with `Role.Admin` | `AdminHome` (stats row + pending requests + users + what's-next) |
| Role placeholder | Signed-in email is in the directory with any other role | `PlaceholderHome` |
| Request access | Signed-in email isn't in the directory | `RequestAccessView` — submits a request into the admin queue |

## Authentication flow

```
/ ──► Continue with Microsoft ──► /login (redirect) ──► /.auth/login/aad ──► Entra ID
                                                                                │
/dashboard ◄── set auth cookies ◄── /.auth/login/aad/callback ◄─────────────────┘
       │
       ├─ fetch /.auth/me
       ├─ AuthService.CurrentUser = email + provider
       ├─ UserDirectory.Find(email)
       │     ├─ Admin    ──► AdminHome
       │     ├─ Other    ──► PlaceholderHome
       │     └─ Missing  ──► RequestAccessView
```

When the user clicks **Sign out**, the app navigates to `/logout`, which the SWA configuration rewrites to `/.auth/logout?post_logout_redirect_uri=/`.

## Run locally on macOS

```bash
brew install --cask dotnet-sdk node
cd jpms
npm install
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

Open the URL printed in the console. Locally there is no SWA emulator and no real `/.auth/me` endpoint, so the AuthService returns `null` and the dashboard redirects to `/login` (which 404s locally). To exercise the full sign-in flow, install the SWA CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli
swa start http://localhost:5000 --run "dotnet run --project jpms"
```

Hot reload:

```bash
dotnet watch --project jpms
```

CSS-only watch:

```bash
cd jpms && npm run watch:css
```

## Deploy to Azure

Two steps. After step 1 you can re-deploy as often as you like with no further setup.

### 1. Provision the Azure resources (one-off)

```bash
az login
az account set --subscription 08c5510c-bb27-4da8-b826-a8e76fb270ec
../infra/azure-setup.sh
```

The script creates the resource group, SQL Server + Serverless DB, Static Web App, and Entra ID app registration; it writes connection details to `infra/.azure-output.env` (gitignored). Copy `SWA_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN` from that file into a GitHub repository secret named `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN`.

### 2. Push to `main`

The workflow in `.github/workflows/jpms-swa.yml` installs Node + .NET, runs `npm install` and `dotnet publish` (which triggers the Tailwind build), then deploys `publish/wwwroot` to Static Web Apps.

## Code style

This codebase follows the style rules in the repository-root `CLAUDE.md`:

- Hard limit of 100 lines per file.
- No comments that explain *what* the code does — the names carry it.
- Booleans use `is`/`has`/`should`/`can` prefixes.
- No abbreviations in identifiers.
- Magic colours and strings live in Tailwind tokens or named constants.

When adding new code, run mentally through CLAUDE.md's pre-commit checklist before merging.

## What lands next

1. **Azure SQL persistence.** Replace `AllowListUserDirectory` and `InMemoryAccessRequestStore` with implementations that call a new API (running on Static Web Apps managed Functions).
2. **Invite-by-email.** Admin can pre-approve a user; the SWA AAD role assignment then surfaces them as a `DirectoryUser` on first sign-in.
3. **Google + email/password.** Add the Google identity provider to `staticwebapp.config.json`; the UI already renders a Google logo button.
4. **First domain screen.** The Programme Valuation Report is the highest-value module — that's the first screen wired to real entities.

Source of truth for what to build next is the user-story register in `/docs/03-workflows/`.

## Cost expectation (testing)

| Resource | Idle | Active |
|---|---|---|
| Static Web App (Free tier) | £0 | £0 up to 250GB/month bandwidth |
| Azure SQL Serverless (with Free-Limit) | £0 (paused) | £0 up to 100k vCore-sec + 32GB/month |
| Entra ID app registration | £0 | £0 |

If the Free-Limit flag isn't accepted on the subscription, the SQL falls back to standard Serverless: ~£3-5/month idle (storage only), pennies per active hour.
