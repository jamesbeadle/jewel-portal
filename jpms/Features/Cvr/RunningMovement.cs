// Jeremy's running-balance format (2026-08-13): each cell's MAIN figure is the running % to
// date at that month end. The SMALL PRINT is the month's OWN margin (the month's profit over
// the month's invoicing) with the month's profit £ beside it, and the cell's COLOUR is the sign
// of that £ — green made money, red lost money (2026-09-07: the small print used to be the
// month's movement in the running %, and the colour followed it; on a job running at 84% a
// month that made £31k at 77% read as a red −0.8, so the cell said "loss" about a profit. A
// red cell must mean the month lost money). The movement in points survives in the hover, and
// a ▲/▼ after the month margin says whether the month ran above or below the job so far.
// The records here are that grid's shape — built by the Profit Summary page, rendered by
